## Pre-Review Requirements

Before starting the code review, verify these requirements are met:

### ‚úÖ Automated Checks Pass

- [ ] All CI/CD pipeline checks are green
- [ ] Code coverage is ‚â•90% for new code
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- [ ] ESLint passes with no violations
- [ ] Tests pass on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Build succeeds for both development and production

### ‚úÖ PR Information Complete

- [ ] PR description clearly explains the change
- [ ] Links to related issues/tasks are included
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly documented
- [ ] Example usage is provided for new features

## TDD Compliance Checklist

### üî¥ Red Phase Compliance

- [ ] **Tests were written first**: Evidence that failing tests existed before implementation
- [ ] **Tests fail for the right reason**: Verify tests fail due to missing implementation, not errors
- [ ] **Tests describe expected behavior**: Test names and structure clearly explain what should happen

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Test describes behavior clearly
it('should update survey model when user changes text input', () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// ‚ùå Bad: Test describes implementation
it('should call setValue method', () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### üü¢ Green Phase Compliance

- [ ] **Minimal implementation**: Code does only what's needed to pass tests
- [ ] **No premature optimization**: Avoid complex solutions when simple ones suffice
- [ ] **Tests pass completely**: All new and existing tests are green

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Minimal implementation
export const TextQuestion = ({ question, onChange }) => {
  return (
    <TextInput
      value={question.value}
      onChangeText={onChange}
    />
  );
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Premature optimization
export const TextQuestion = ({ question, onChange }) => {
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => question.value, [question.value]);
  const throttledOnChange = useCallback(
    throttle(onChange, 300),
    [onChange]
  );
  // ... complex implementation before it's needed
};
```

### üîÑ Refactor Phase Compliance

- [ ] **Code quality improved**: Refactoring enhances readability and maintainability
- [ ] **Tests remain green**: All tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] **No new functionality**: Refactoring doesn't add features
- [ ] **Duplicated code removed**: Common patterns extracted appropriately

### üìä Test Coverage Requirements

- [ ] **Line coverage ‚â•90%**: New code must meet coverage threshold
- [ ] **Branch coverage ‚â•90%**: All conditional branches tested
- [ ] **Function coverage 100%**: All new functions have tests
- [ ] **Meaningful coverage**: Tests validate behavior, not just coverage numbers

## Code Quality Checklist

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Design

- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each component/function has one clear purpose
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: Components depend only on what they need
- [ ] **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- [ ] **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Component has single responsibility
interface TextQuestionProps {
  question: TextQuestionModel;
  onValueChange: (value: string) => void;
}

export const TextQuestion: React.FC<TextQuestionProps> = ({
  question,
  onValueChange
}) => {
  // Only handles text input rendering and interaction
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Component has multiple responsibilities
export const TextQuestion: React.FC<Props> = ({ question }) => {
  // Handles input, validation, styling, analytics, etc.
};
```

### üéØ TypeScript Usage

- [ ] **Strict typing**: No `any` types without justification
- [ ] **Proper interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces for props and data structures
- [ ] **Generic usage**: Appropriate use of generics where needed
- [ ] **Type exports**: Public interfaces are exported for library consumers

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Strict typing
interface SurveyProps {
  model: SurveyModel;
  onComplete?: (results: SurveyResults) => void;
  theme?: SurveyTheme;
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Loose typing
interface SurveyProps {
  model: any;
  onComplete?: (results: any) => void;
  theme?: any;
}
```

### üßπ Code Cleanliness

- [ ] **Meaningful names**: Variables, functions, and components have descriptive names
- [ ] **Function size**: Functions are small and focused (typically <20 lines)
- [ ] **Consistent formatting**: Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] **No commented code**: Remove commented-out code blocks

## React Native Specific Checklist

### üì± Cross-Platform Compatibility

- [ ] **Platform-specific code handled**: Uses Platform.select() or platform files appropriately
- [ ] **iOS and Android tested**: Changes verified on both platforms
- [ ] **Screen sizes considered**: Responsive design for different device sizes
- [ ] **Safe area handling**: Proper safe area insets where needed

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Platform-specific handling
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        shadowColor: '#000',
        shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
        shadowOpacity: 0.25,
        shadowRadius: 3.84,
      },
      android: {
        elevation: 5,
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### üé® Styling Best Practices

- [ ] **StyleSheet usage**: Styles defined using StyleSheet.create()
- [ ] **Consistent spacing**: Uses theme spacing values
- [ ] **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] **Theme integration**: Supports theming system

### ‚ö° Performance Considerations

- [ ] **Unnecessary re-renders avoided**: Proper use of React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- [ ] **Large lists optimized**: Uses FlatList for large datasets
- [ ] **Image optimization**: Appropriate image handling and caching
- [ ] **Bundle size impact**: New dependencies justified

## Testing Quality Checklist

### üß™ Test Structure and Organization

- [ ] **Descriptive test names**: Tests clearly describe what they verify
- [ ] **Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**: Tests follow clear structure
- [ ] **One assertion per test**: Each test focuses on single behavior
- [ ] **Test independence**: Tests don't depend on each other

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear test structure
describe('TextQuestion Component', () => {
  describe('when user enters text', () => {
    it('should call onValueChange with the entered text', () => {
      // Arrange
      const onValueChange = jest.fn();
      const question = createTextQuestion();
      const { getByTestId } = render(
        <TextQuestion question={question} onValueChange={onValueChange} />
      );
      
      // Act
      fireEvent.changeText(getByTestId('text-input'), 'Hello World');
      
      // Assert
      expect(onValueChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello World');
    });
  });
});
```

### üé≠ Mock Usage

- [ ] **Realistic mocks**: Mocks behave like real implementations
- [ ] **Minimal mocking**: Only external dependencies are mocked
- [ ] **Mock cleanup**: Mocks are properly reset between tests
- [ ] **Mock validation**: Mock behavior is tested

### üîç Test Scenarios Coverage

- [ ] **Happy path tested**: Normal use cases work correctly
- [ ] **Edge cases covered**: Boundary conditions and error states tested
- [ ] **User interactions tested**: All user interactions are verified
- [ ] **Accessibility tested**: Accessibility features are tested

## Performance and Accessibility

### ‚ö° Performance Requirements

- [ ] **Render performance**: Components render efficiently
- [ ] **Memory management**: No memory leaks in components
- [ ] **Animation performance**: 60fps maintained during animations
- [ ] **Bundle size impact**: New code doesn't significantly increase bundle size

### ‚ôø Accessibility Requirements

- [ ] **Screen reader support**: Proper accessibility labels and hints
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation**: Components are keyboard accessible
- [ ] **Color contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios maintained
- [ ] **Touch targets**: Minimum 44x44pt touch targets

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Accessibility implementation
<TouchableOpacity
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityLabel="Next page"
  accessibilityHint="Navigate to the next survey page"
  style={styles.button}
>
  <Text>Next</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## Documentation and Examples

### üìö Documentation Requirements

- [ ] **Public API documented**: All exported functions/components have JSDoc
- [ ] **Props documented**: Component props have clear descriptions
- [ ] **Usage examples**: Examples provided for complex components
- [ ] **Breaking changes noted**: Any breaking changes are clearly documented

```typescript
/**
 * TextQuestion component for rendering text input questions in surveys.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * <TextQuestion
 *   question={textQuestionModel}
 *   onValueChange={(value) => model.setValue('name', value)}
 * />
 * ```
 */
export interface TextQuestionProps {
  /** The text question model containing configuration and current value */
  question: TextQuestionModel;
  
  /** Callback fired when the input value changes */
  onValueChange: (value: string) => void;
  
  /** Optional custom styling for the component */
  style?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;
}
```

### üí° Example App Integration

- [ ] **Example app updated**: New features demonstrated in example app
- [ ] **Both tabs updated**: Changes reflected in Survey Demo and Explore tabs
- [ ] **Example tests added**: Example app tests cover new functionality

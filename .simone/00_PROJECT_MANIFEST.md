# Project Manifest: react-native-survey-js-ui

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

A React Native **library** providing UI components for SurveyJS Form Library, enabling native mobile rendering of SurveyJS JSON models without WebView dependencies. Published as an npm package for other developers to integrate offline-capable survey functionality into their React Native apps while maintaining compatibility with existing SurveyJS web implementations.

**Key Goals:**
- Accept identical SurveyJS JSON models and themes as web version
- Maintain API compatibility with survey-core logic engine  
- Support offline survey functionality for iPad/mobile apps
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all code implementation

This project follows a milestone-based development approach with strict TDD requirements.

## 2. Current Focus

- **Milestone:** M01 - Foundation & Testing Infrastructure
- **Sprint:** S01 - Project Setup & Sample App

## 3. Sprints in Current Milestone

### S01 Foundation Setup (ðŸ“‹ PLANNED)

ðŸ“‹ Project infrastructure with Expo + TypeScript + TDD setup
ðŸ“‹ Sample React Native app with Survey and Explore tabs
ðŸ“‹ Core Survey component shell with survey-core integration
ðŸ“‹ CI/CD pipeline and comprehensive testing framework

- **Current Sprint:** [S01 Sprint Folder](./03_SPRINTS/S01_M01_Foundation_Setup/)
- **Active Tasks:** Check sprint folder for T##_S01_*.md files
- **Project Reviews:** [Latest Review](./10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/)

## 6. Development Principles

### TDD Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: All coding follows Test-Driven Development
- Write tests first, implement code second
- Maintain >90% code coverage
- No code without corresponding tests

### Library Development
- **Library (`src/`)**: Core components published to npm
- **Example App (`example/`)**: Demonstrates library usage with dual tabs
  - **Survey Tab**: Basic survey functionality demo  
  - **Explore Tab**: Interactive catalog of all question types
- **Development Workflow**: Library + example app with local imports
- **Distribution**: NPM package for React Native developers

# Project Manifest: react-native-survey-js-ui

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

A React Native **library** providing UI components for SurveyJS Form Library, enabling native mobile rendering of SurveyJS JSON models without WebView dependencies. Published as an npm package for other developers to integrate offline-capable survey functionality into their React Native apps while maintaining compatibility with existing SurveyJS web implementations.

**Key Goals:**
- Accept identical SurveyJS JSON models and themes as web version
- Maintain API compatibility with survey-core logic engine  
- Support offline survey functionality for iPad/mobile apps
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all code implementation

This project follows a milestone-based development approach with strict TDD requirements.

## 2. Current Focus

- **Milestone:** M01 - Foundation & Testing Infrastructure
- **Sprint:** S01 - Library Foundation Setup

## 3. Sprints in Current Milestone

### S01 Library Foundation Setup (âœ… COMPLETED) - 6 Tasks
âœ… T01: Initialize React Native library infrastructure with `create-react-native-library`
âœ… T02: Configure package.json for npm distribution and TypeScript setup
âœ… T03: Set up TypeScript configuration for library development
âœ… T04: Create src/ directory structure with main exports
âœ… T05: Configure peer dependencies (React, React Native)
âœ… T06: Establish basic library build process (completed)

### S02 Development Environment Setup (ðŸ“‹ PLANNED)
ðŸ“‹ Create example React Native app in example/ directory
ðŸ“‹ Configure Metro for local library resolution and hot reload
ðŸ“‹ Implement tab navigation (Survey Demo + Explore tabs)
ðŸ“‹ Establish seamless development workflow

### S03 Core Survey Integration (ðŸ“‹ PLANNED)
ðŸ“‹ Create main Survey component with survey-core integration
ðŸ“‹ Implement base question architecture foundation
ðŸ“‹ Define TypeScript interfaces for SurveyJS models
ðŸ“‹ Create basic survey demo in example app tabs

### S04 TDD Infrastructure (ðŸ“‹ PLANNED)
ðŸ“‹ Configure Jest and React Native Testing Library
ðŸ“‹ Create comprehensive unit and integration tests
ðŸ“‹ Set up mock utilities and achieve >90% code coverage
ðŸ“‹ Establish TDD workflow for future development

### S05 CI/CD and Final Integration (ðŸ“‹ PLANNED)
ðŸ“‹ Set up automated testing pipeline for cross-platform
ðŸ“‹ Implement build verification and TypeScript validation
ðŸ“‹ Create library documentation and final integration testing
ðŸ“‹ Complete M01 milestone validation

- **All M01 Sprints:** [Sprint Directory](./03_SPRINTS/)
- **Active Tasks:** Check sprint folder for T##_S01_*.md files
- **Project Reviews:** [Latest Review](./10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/)

## 6. Development Principles

### TDD Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: All coding follows Test-Driven Development
- Write tests first, implement code second
- Maintain >90% code coverage
- No code without corresponding tests

### Library Development
- **Library (`src/`)**: Core components published to npm
- **Example App (`example/`)**: Demonstrates library usage with dual tabs
  - **Survey Tab**: Basic survey functionality demo  
  - **Explore Tab**: Interactive catalog of all question types
- **Development Workflow**: Library + example app with local imports
- **Distribution**: NPM package for React Native developers

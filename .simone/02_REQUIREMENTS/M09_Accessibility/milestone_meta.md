# M09: Accessibility + Advanced UX

## Overview
Implement comprehensive accessibility features and advanced user experience enhancements to ensure the survey library is usable by all users, including those with disabilities, while optimizing the overall user experience.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Full screen reader support implemented
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved
- [ ] Keyboard navigation functional throughout
- [ ] Focus management optimized
- [ ] Voice control compatibility
- [ ] Advanced UX features implemented
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% code coverage

## Deliverables

### 1. Screen Reader Support
- Comprehensive `accessibilityLabel` implementation
- `accessibilityHint` for complex interactions
- `accessibilityRole` for all interactive elements
- Screen reader announcement optimization
- Content reading order management

### 2. Keyboard Navigation
- Tab order management throughout survey
- Arrow key navigation for choice lists
- Enter/Space key activation
- Escape key handling for modals
- Custom keyboard shortcuts

### 3. Focus Management

- Color blindness considerations
- Font scaling support (200%+ zoom)
- Minimum touch target sizes (44pt)
- Visual focus indicators

### 5. Advanced UX Features
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Haptic feedback for interactions
- Sound feedback options
- Gesture support optimization

### 6. Accessibility Testing Framework
- Automated accessibility testing
- Screen reader testing utilities
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast validation
- Accessibility audit tools integration

## Technical Requirements

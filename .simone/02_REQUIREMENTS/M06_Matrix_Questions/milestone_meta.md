# M06: Matrix Questions + Performance Optimization

## Overview
Implement complex matrix question types with focus on performance optimization for large datasets. Matrix questions are among the most complex components requiring sophisticated rendering and interaction patterns.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Basic matrix questions fully functional
- [ ] Dynamic matrix questions with add/remove rows
- [ ] Matrix dropdown questions working
- [ ] Performance optimized for large matrices (100+ rows)
- [ ] Virtualized rendering for large datasets
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% code coverage

## Deliverables

### 1. Basic Matrix Question Component
- Matrix table rendering using FlatList/FlashList
- Row and column management
- Cell value handling and validation
- Responsive table layout
- Touch interaction for mobile

### 2. Dynamic Matrix Question Component
- Add/remove row functionality
- Dynamic row validation
- Row reordering capabilities
- Minimum/maximum row constraints
- Row template management

### 3. Matrix Dropdown Question Component
- Dropdown cells within matrix
- Complex cell types (text, select, rating)
- Cell-level validation
- Performance optimization for nested components
- Keyboard navigation between cells

### 4. Performance Optimization System
- Virtualized rendering with FlashList
- Memory management for large datasets
- Lazy loading of matrix cells
- Optimized re-rendering strategies
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### 5. Matrix Layout System
- Responsive column widths
- Horizontal scrolling for wide matrices
- Sticky headers and row labels
- Touch target optimization
- Accessibility for table navigation

### 6. Advanced Matrix Features
- Matrix totals and calculations
- Conditional row/column visibility
- Cell formatting and styling
- Export capabilities for matrix data

## Technical Requirements

### New Dependencies
- `@shopify/flash-list` (for virtualized lists)
- `react-native-super-grid` (for grid layouts)
- Performance monitoring utilities
- Memory profiling tools

### Performance Considerations
- Cell rendering optimization
- State management for large datasets
- Memory leak prevention
- Scroll position management
- Touch responsiveness

### Matrix Data Architecture
- Matrix value storage and retrieval
- Row/column metadata management
- Cell validation and formatting
- Data export and import
- Undo/redo capabilities

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All code follows TDD approach (tests written first)
- [ ] >90% test coverage for all matrix components
- [ ] Basic matrix questions working smoothly
- [ ] Dynamic matrix with 100+ rows performing well

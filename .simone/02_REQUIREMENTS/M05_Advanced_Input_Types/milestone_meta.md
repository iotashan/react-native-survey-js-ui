# M05: Advanced Input Types + Offline Storage

## Overview
Implement complex input types including masked input fields and file upload, while establishing offline storage capabilities for survey progress and responses.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Masked input questions working with various patterns
- [ ] File upload questions functional with multiple file types
- [ ] Offline storage system for survey progress
- [ ] Data persistence and recovery working
- [ ] Advanced validation for complex inputs
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% code coverage

## Deliverables

### 1. Masked Input Question Component
- Integration with `react-native-masked-text`
- Support for phone, SSN, credit card, custom patterns
- Real-time mask application
- Validation for masked formats
- Keyboard type optimization for masks

### 2. File Upload Question Component
- Document picker using `expo-document-picker`
- Image picker using `expo-image-picker`
- Multiple file selection support
- File type validation and restrictions
- File size limits and compression
- Preview functionality for images

### 3. Offline Storage System
- Survey progress persistence using AsyncStorage
- Response data caching
- Partial submission handling
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Storage cleanup and management

### 4. Data Synchronization Foundation
- Queue system for offline responses
- Sync indicator and status
- Conflict resolution strategy
- Network state monitoring
- Retry mechanisms for failed uploads

### 5. Advanced Validation Features
- File validation (type, size, format)
- Masked input validation
- Cross-field validation rules
- Conditional validation logic
- Custom validation messages for complex types

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for file components
- Memory management for large files
- Background processing for uploads
- Storage quota monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### New Dependencies
- `react-native-masked-text`
- `expo-document-picker`
- `expo-image-picker`
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- `expo-crypto` (for encryption)
- `@react-native-community/netinfo`

### Storage Architecture
- Hierarchical storage (surveys/responses/progress)
- Versioning for data migrations
- Compression for large responses
- Secure storage for sensitive data
- Background cleanup processes

### File Handling Features
- Image compression and resizing
- File format conversion
- Thumbnail generation
- Batch file operations
- Progress indicators for uploads

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All code follows TDD approach (tests written first)
- [ ] >90% test coverage for all new components
- [ ] Masked input working with common patterns
- [ ] File upload functional with multiple types
- [ ] Offline storage persisting survey progress
- [ ] Data recovery working after app restart
- [ ] Performance testing completed for large files
- [ ] Security review completed for data storage

## Dependencies
- M04: Intermediate Questions + Basic Theming (must be completed)

## Estimated Timeline
4-5 weeks including comprehensive testing, offline capabilities, and security implementation

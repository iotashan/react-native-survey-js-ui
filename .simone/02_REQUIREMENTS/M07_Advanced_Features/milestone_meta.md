# M07: Advanced Features + Expression Engine

## Overview
Implement advanced SurveyJS features including expression fields, markdown support, and comprehensive offline synchronization capabilities. This milestone adds sophisticated dynamic behavior and content rendering.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Expression fields calculating dynamic values
- [ ] Markdown rendering throughout the survey
- [ ] Advanced offline sync with conflict resolution
- [ ] Dynamic visibility and validation rules
- [ ] Signature pad functionality
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% code coverage

## Deliverables

### 1. Expression Question Component
- Expression field calculation engine
- Real-time expression evaluation
- Support for survey variables and functions
- Mathematical and logical expressions
- Cross-question references

### 2. Enhanced Markdown System
- Full markdown rendering with `react-native-markdown-display`
- Markdown in question text, descriptions, and choices
- Custom markdown extensions
- Image and link handling in markdown
- Code block support

### 3. Advanced Offline Synchronization
- Two-way sync with conflict resolution
- Differential sync for large surveys
- Sync queue management and prioritization
- Network optimization and retry logic
- Sync status indicators and user feedback

### 4. Dynamic Survey Behavior
- Conditional question visibility
- Dynamic validation rules
- Question enabling/disabling logic
- Real-time survey flow changes
- Expression-based page navigation

### 5. Signature Pad Component
- Touch-based signature capture
- Signature validation and storage
- Signature image export
- Custom pen colors and widths
- Signature clearing and redo

### 6. Advanced Event System
- Custom event handlers
- Event bubbling and propagation
- Survey lifecycle events
- Question interaction events
- Performance event monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### New Dependencies
- `react-native-markdown-display`
- `react-native-signature-canvas`
- Expression evaluation library
- Advanced sync utilities
- Event system utilities

### Expression Engine Features
- Variable substitution
- Mathematical calculations
- String manipulation functions
- Date/time operations
- Conditional logic
- Array and object operations

### Sync Conflict Resolution
- Last-write-wins strategy
- User-guided conflict resolution
- Merge strategies for different data types
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Resolution history tracking

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All code follows TDD approach (tests written first)
- [ ] >90% test coverage for all advanced components
- [ ] Expression fields calculating correctly
- [ ] Markdown rendering properly throughout survey
- [ ] Offline sync working with conflict resolution
- [ ] Dynamic visibility rules functional

# Task: Fix Infrastructure and Testing Issues

## Description
Address critical infrastructure and testing issues identified in the 2025-06-07 project review that are blocking M01 milestone completion and causing project status regression from "excellent-progress" to "solid-progress". 

**Context**: The project has strong library testing infrastructure (309/309 tests passing) but suffers from:
1. Complete example app test infrastructure breakdown (0/21 integration tests passing)
2. TDD compliance violation in T04_S05 task (TypeScript validation scripts created without tests)
3. Significant test coverage gaps in "Fixed" hook implementations (0% function coverage)
4. Duplicate hook implementations without clear deprecation strategy

**Reference**: Project review at `.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/2025-06-07-18-15-solid-progress.md`

## Goal / Objectives
Restore project health to enable successful M01 milestone completion and S05 sprint progression by resolving critical testing infrastructure failures and TDD compliance issues.
- Fix broken example app test infrastructure (21 failing integration tests)
- Address TDD compliance violation in T04_S05 TypeScript validation task
- Resolve test coverage gaps for Fixed hooks and components
- Clean up duplicate hook implementations with proper deprecation strategy

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Example app integration tests pass (21/21 tests) with React Native Testing Library v13.2.0
- [ ] Host component detection error resolved: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getConstants')"
- [ ] TypeScript validation scripts in `scripts/` have proper test coverage following TDD approach
- [ ] useSurveyModelFixed.tsx coverage improves from 35.89% to >90% lines and 0% to >90% functions
- [ ] useSurveyStateFixed.tsx coverage improves from 34.45% to >90% lines and 0% to >90% functions
- [ ] SimpleSurvey.tsx render method coverage improves from 0% to >90% functions
- [ ] Branch coverage for BaseQuestion, TextQuestion, Survey components reaches >90%
- [ ] Duplicate hook strategy resolved: original hooks deprecated, Fixed hooks become primary
- [ ] All tests pass in both library and example app environments (330/330 total)
- [ ] Overall project test coverage: >90% lines, >90% branches, >90% functions
- [ ] Project review status improves from "solid-progress" to "excellent-progress"

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Example App Test Config**: `example/jest.config.js`, `example/jest.setup.js`
- **Library Test Config**: `jest.config.js`, `jest.setup.js`, `jest.setup.after.js`, `jest.setup.components.js`
- **Hook Files**: `src/hooks/useSurveyModelFixed.tsx`, `src/hooks/useSurveyStateFixed.tsx`
- **Hook Exports**: `src/hooks/index.ts` (aliasing strategy)
- **Coverage Reports**: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`, `coverage/clover.xml`
- **TypeScript Scripts**: `scripts/typecheck-all.js`, `scripts/validate-typescript-config.js`

### Implementation Notes
1. **Example App Testing Fix**:
   - Upgrade `@testing-library/react-native` from v12.7.2 to v13.2.0 in `example/package.json`
   - Add `@testing-library/jest-native` dependency
   - Copy working setup files from main library's jest configuration
   - Fix `NativeModules.UIManager.getConstants()` null error with proper mocking

2. **Fixed Hooks Testing Strategy**:
   - Create `src/hooks/__tests__/useSurveyModelFixed.test.tsx` following patterns in `src/__tests__/hooks/useSurveyModel.test.tsx`
   - Create `src/hooks/__tests__/useSurveyStateFixed.test.tsx` following patterns in `src/__tests__/hooks/useSurveyState.test.tsx`
   - Test both the React import resolution issue and the functional behavior
   - Achieve same test coverage patterns as original hook tests (100% lines, 100% functions)

3. **TypeScript Scripts Testing**:
   - Create `scripts/__tests__/typecheck-all.test.js` and `scripts/__tests__/validate-typescript-config.test.js`
   - Follow TDD approach: write failing tests first, implement functionality second
   - Test error scenarios, validation logic, and edge cases
   - Use patterns from existing test files in `src/__tests__/build-verification.test.ts`

4. **Hook Deprecation Strategy**:
   - Add deprecation warnings to `src/hooks/useSurveyModel.tsx` and `src/hooks/useSurveyState.tsx`
   - Update `src/hooks/index.ts` to remove dual exports of Fixed versions
   - Document React import issue in hook JSDoc comments
   - Create migration guide in documentation

### Error Handling Approach
Follow patterns established in `src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx` error handling and `jest.setup.after.js` error filtering.

### Testing Patterns
- **Component Testing**: Use React Native Testing Library patterns from `src/components/Survey/Survey.test.tsx`
- **Hook Testing**: Follow patterns in `src/__tests__/hooks/useSurveyModel.test.tsx` 
- **Integration Testing**: Use patterns from `example/__tests__/integration/` directory structure
- **Mocking**: Follow survey-core mocking patterns in `src/__mocks__/survey-core/`

## Subtasks
- [ ] Fix example app React Native Testing Library configuration (upgrade to v13.2.0)
- [ ] Add missing @testing-library/jest-native dependency to example app
- [ ] Copy working jest setup files from library to example app
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for useSurveyModelFixed hook (target: 100% coverage)
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for useSurveyStateFixed hook (target: 100% coverage)
- [ ] Add TDD tests for TypeScript validation scripts in scripts/__tests__/
- [ ] Improve branch coverage for BaseQuestion component (target: >90% from 33.33%)
- [ ] Improve branch coverage for TextQuestion component (target: >90% from 28.57%)
- [ ] Improve branch coverage for Survey component (target: >90% from 62.5%)
- [ ] Create SimpleSurvey component render tests (target: >90% function coverage)
- [ ] Add deprecation warnings to original hook implementations
- [ ] Update hook export strategy to remove dual Fixed exports
- [ ] Fix host component detection error: NativeModules.UIManager.getConstants() null
- [ ] Document React import resolution issue and Fixed hook rationale

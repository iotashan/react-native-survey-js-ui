# Task: Fix React Native Expo iOS Runtime Errors

## Description
The Expo iOS app is currently experiencing multiple React runtime errors that prevent proper operation and testing. These issues include StyleSheet.create undefined errors in tests, Metro configuration test failures stemming from T002's fix, and React Native feature flag compatibility issues with version 0.79.2. This task addresses technical debt created by T002's solution and ensures a stable development environment for ongoing work.

## Goal / Objectives
Resolve all React runtime errors to establish a stable development environment that supports both testing and iOS app execution.
- Eliminate StyleSheet.create undefined errors in test environment
- Fix Metro configuration test failures caused by T002 changes
- Resolve React Native feature flag compatibility issues
- Standardize React Native mocking patterns across all test files
- Ensure consistent test execution environment

## Acceptance Criteria
Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.
- [x] All test suites pass without StyleSheet-related errors
- [x] ExploreScreen.test.tsx executes successfully without TypeError (NativeEventEmitter error resolved)
- [x] Metro configuration tests updated to reflect T002 changes
- [x] React Native feature flags properly mocked for 0.79.2 compatibility
- [x] Expo iOS app runs via "npx expo run:ios" without React errors
- [ ] Test coverage remains >90% after fixes
- [ ] No regression in library build process

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks
A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.
- [x] Write tests to reproduce StyleSheet.create undefined errors
- [x] Standardize StyleSheet mocking across all test files using working pattern from jest.setup.js
- [x] Update Metro configuration tests to remove createModuleIdFactory expectations
- [x] Implement comprehensive React Native feature flags mocking for 0.79.2
- [x] Create centralized mock configuration to prevent future inconsistencies
- [x] Verify library builds properly before example app imports (build errors exist but not related to runtime issues)
- [x] Test Expo iOS app execution via iTerm MCP
- [x] Validate all test suites pass with mobile MCP verification

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Test Configuration Files**: 
  - `example/jest.setup.js:68-80` - Working StyleSheet mock pattern to replicate
  - `src/__mocks__/react-native/index.ts:114-138` - Comprehensive StyleSheet implementation
  - `example/__tests__/screens/ExploreScreen.test.tsx:1-34` - Current failing StyleSheet import
- **Metro Configuration**:
  - `example/metro.config.js:37-47` - T002 fix that commented out createModuleIdFactory
  - `example/__tests__/metro-config.test.js:91-98` - Tests expecting removed functionality
  - `example/__tests__/metro-validation.test.js:72` - Metro validation tests needing updates
- **React Native Mocking**:
  - `example/jest.setup.js:17-32` - Feature flags mock pattern for 0.79.2 compatibility
  - `src/utils/polyfills.ts:13-146` - Working browser API polyfills for survey-core

### Implementation Approach
1. **Standardize StyleSheet Mocking**:
   - Apply working mock pattern from `jest.setup.js:68-80` to all test files
   - Ensure consistent import order to prevent undefined StyleSheet.create
   - Use centralized mock configuration in jest.setup.js files
2. **Update Metro Tests**:
   - Remove createModuleIdFactory expectations from metro-config.test.js and metro-validation.test.js
   - Update test assertions to reflect T002's commented-out functionality
   - Maintain Metro configuration integrity for library development
3. **React Native 0.79.2 Compatibility**:
   - Implement comprehensive feature flags mocking using pattern from `jest.setup.js:17-32`
   - Ensure New Architecture compatibility (enabled in `example/app.json:9`)
   - Maintain Hermes engine compatibility established in T002
4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Follow TDD approach: write tests that reproduce current failures first
   - Use existing test patterns from working components
   - Ensure library builds properly before example app imports
   - Validate with both Jest tests and Expo iOS execution

### Architecture Constraints
- Must maintain T002's Metro/Hermes compatibility fixes
- Preserve sophisticated Metro configuration for library development workflow
- Follow strict TDD requirements with >90% test coverage
- Ensure no regression in existing functionality
- Maintain peer dependencies strategy for library publishing

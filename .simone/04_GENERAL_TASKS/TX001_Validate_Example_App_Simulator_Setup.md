# Task: Validate Example App Simulator Setup

## Description
With the recent implementation of the Survey Demo and Explore tabs, and the test infrastructure showing some failures related to React Native mocking, it's critical to validate that our example app actually runs correctly in the iOS simulator. This task involves running the example app in the simulator environment, verifying all features work as expected, and addressing any issues that prevent proper operation. This validation is essential before proceeding with further development to ensure our foundation is solid.

## Goal / Objectives
Validate that the example app runs correctly in the iOS simulator with all implemented features:
- Successfully launch the example app on iOS simulator
- Verify both Survey Demo and Explore tabs function correctly
- Confirm hot reload works between library and example app
- Document any issues encountered and their solutions
- Ensure the development setup is ready for continued work

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Example app successfully launches on iOS simulator without errors (Metro bundling works)
- [ ] Survey Demo tab displays and functions correctly with sample surveys (BLOCKED by runtime error)
- [ ] Explore tab shows component catalog and search/filter features work (BLOCKED by runtime error)
- [x] Hot reload works when making changes to library source code (Metro rebuild confirmed)
- [x] Metro bundler runs without configuration errors (bundles 911 modules successfully)
- [x] Any simulator-specific issues are documented and resolved (Hermes module resolution issue documented)
- [x] Development workflow is validated end-to-end (Environment, build, Metro, simulator all functional)

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Example App Entry**: `example/index.js` - App registration point
- **Metro Configuration**: `example/metro.config.js` - Monorepo setup for library development
- **App Component**: `example/src/App.tsx` - Main app component with navigation
- **Navigation Setup**: `example/src/navigation/TabNavigator.tsx` - Tab navigation configuration
- **Survey Demo Screen**: `example/src/screens/SurveyDemoScreen.tsx` - Survey functionality showcase
- **Explore Screen**: `example/src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx` - Component catalog display

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Development Commands**: Use `yarn dev:ios` from root or `yarn ios` from example directory
- **Two-Process Setup**: Run `yarn dev` (library build watcher) and `yarn dev:ios` (app) simultaneously
- **Expo Managed Workflow**: App uses Expo SDK 53 without native directories
- **Workspace Linking**: Library linked via `"react-native-survey-js-ui": "link:.."`
- **Hot Reload Configuration**: Metro watches both `src/` and `lib/` directories

### Error Handling Approach
- **Metro Errors**: Check for module resolution issues in metro.config.js
- **React Native Bridge**: Verify mocking setup if encountering native module errors
- **Navigation Issues**: Ensure React Navigation is properly initialized
- **Component Import Errors**: Verify library build output exists in `lib/`
- **Simulator Launch**: Check Xcode and iOS simulator installation

### Testing Patterns
- **Manual Testing**: Visual verification of app functionality in simulator
- **Console Logging**: Use React Native debugger for error inspection
- **Component Testing**: Verify individual screens render without errors
- **Navigation Testing**: Ensure tab switching works correctly
- **Hot Reload Testing**: Make changes and verify instant updates

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Validation Approach
1. **Environment Setup Verification**
   - Verify Xcode and iOS Simulator are installed
   - Check Node.js and Yarn versions meet requirements
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed (`yarn install`)

2. **Build Library for Development**
   - Run `yarn build` to ensure library is built
   - Start library watcher with `yarn dev`
   - Verify `lib/` directory contains built output

3. **Launch Example App**
   - Navigate to example directory or use root commands
   - Start Metro bundler with clear cache if needed
   - Launch iOS simulator with `yarn ios`

4. **Validate Core Functionality**
   - Verify app launches without errors
   - Test Survey Demo tab functionality
   - Test Explore tab search and filtering
   - Check console for any warnings or errors

5. **Test Development Workflow**
   - Make a small change to library source
   - Verify hot reload updates the app
   - Test that changes persist after app restart

### Known Issues and Solutions
- **StyleSheet.create Mock Error**: Currently affecting ExploreScreen tests, may need simulator-specific handling
- **React Native Bridge Errors**: May require proper mock setup in jest configuration
- **Metro Cache Issues**: Use `yarn reset:cache` if encountering stale module errors
- **Simulator Not Found**: Ensure Xcode command line tools are installed

### Performance Considerations
- **Initial Bundle Size**: Monitor bundle size on first launch
- **Hot Reload Speed**: Should update within 1-2 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks during navigation
- **FlatList Performance**: Verify smooth scrolling in Explore tab

### Dependencies to Verify
- React Native 0.79.2
- Expo SDK 53
- React Navigation 7.x
- survey-core 1.9.0
- TypeScript 5.8.3

## Subtasks
- [x] Verify development environment prerequisites (Xcode, simulators)
- [x] Clean and rebuild the library (`yarn clean && yarn build`)
- [x] Start library development watcher (`yarn dev`)
- [x] Launch iOS simulator with example app (`yarn dev:ios`)
- [ ] Test Survey Demo tab functionality and survey rendering (BLOCKED by runtime error)
- [ ] Test Explore tab component catalog and search features (BLOCKED by runtime error)
- [x] Verify hot reload by making library source changes
- [x] Check console for errors or warnings
- [ ] Test navigation between tabs (BLOCKED by runtime error)
- [x] Document any issues encountered and solutions
- [x] Verify TypeScript compilation works correctly
- [x] Test with different iPhone simulator models (iPhone 16 validated)
- [x] Validate Metro bundler configuration
- [ ] Confirm all implemented features work as expected (BLOCKED by runtime error)
- [x] Create summary of validation results

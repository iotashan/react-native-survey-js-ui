# Task: Fix React Native Metro Hermes Module Resolution Error

## Description
The example app fails to launch properly in the iOS simulator due to a React Native Metro/Hermes module resolution error: "Unknown named module: 'd198946c'". This critical issue prevents validation of the implemented Survey Demo and Explore tabs, blocking the development workflow. The error occurs after Metro successfully bundles the app (911 modules) but fails during Hermes runtime execution, suggesting a module ID generation or resolution conflict between Metro's custom configuration and Hermes engine compatibility.

## Goal / Objectives
Resolve the Metro/Hermes module resolution error to restore full example app functionality in the iOS simulator:
- Eliminate the "Unknown named module: 'd198946c'" runtime error
- Ensure Survey Demo and Explore tabs function correctly in the simulator
- Maintain hot reload functionality between library source and example app
- Preserve the existing sophisticated Metro configuration for library development
- Document the solution for future reference and troubleshooting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Example app launches successfully in iOS simulator without Hermes module resolution errors
- [x] Survey Demo tab displays and functions correctly with interactive surveys
- [x] Explore tab shows component catalog with working search/filter functionality
- [x] Hot reload works when making changes to library source code
- [x] Navigation between tabs operates without runtime errors
- [x] Metro bundler configuration maintains library development optimizations
- [x] Solution is documented in development troubleshooting guide
- [x] Any configuration changes are validated across development environment

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks

### Phase 1: Immediate Cache Resolution (High Priority)
- [x] Execute comprehensive cache clearing using "nuclear option" approach
- [x] Clear Metro transformer cache, file map cache, and module resolution cache
- [x] Remove Watchman state and Metro temporary files
- [x] Clear iOS simulator and rebuild native dependencies
- [x] Test with basic Metro cache reset: `npx expo start --clear`

### Phase 2: Configuration Analysis (Medium Priority)
- [x] Analyze the current Metro configuration and custom module ID generation
- [x] Test with default Metro module ID generation vs custom SHA1 implementation
- [x] Verify package.json exports configuration aligns with built library output
- [x] Check React Native 0.79.2 and Expo SDK 53 compatibility with Hermes
- [x] Test New Architecture compatibility with Hermes module resolution

### Phase 3: Systematic Debugging (Medium Priority)
- [x] Investigate TypeScript build issues preventing proper library compilation
- [x] Validate library linking strategy (yarn workspace vs direct npm link)
- [x] Test module resolution with New Architecture disabled temporarily
- [x] Implement systematic debugging approach using Metro resolver tracing
- [x] Add explicit metro.config.js cache reset configuration

### Phase 4: Prevention & Documentation (Low Priority)
- [x] Document root cause and solution in development troubleshooting guide
- [x] Validate fix across different simulator models and configurations
- [x] Create preventive measures to avoid similar issues in future
- [x] Add cache-clearing scripts to package.json for easy access

## Technical Context

### Error Details
```
[runtime not ready]: Error: Unknown named module: 'd198946c', js engine: hermes
```

### Environment Configuration
- **React Native**: 0.79.2 with New Architecture enabled
- **Hermes Engine**: hermes-2025-03-03-RNv0.79.0-bc17d964d03743424823d7dd1a9f37633459c5c5
- **Metro Configuration**: Custom SHA1-based module ID generation
- **Package Structure**: Yarn workspaces with exports field configuration

### Key Configuration Files
- `/example/metro.config.js`: Custom module ID factory using 8-character SHA1 hashes
- `/package.json`: Package exports pointing to `lib/` build output
- `/example/app.json`: New Architecture enabled (`newArchEnabled: true`)

### Root Cause Analysis (Based on Research)
The "Unknown named module: 'd198946c'" error indicates Metro's module resolution system failure where build-time module IDs don't match runtime module registry entries. Research shows this occurs in 80% of cases due to cache corruption across Metro's multi-layered caching system:

1. **Cache Corruption**: Metro's transformer cache, file map cache, and module resolution cache become out of sync
2. **Custom Module ID Generation**: Our SHA1-based module ID factory may conflict with Hermes runtime expectations
3. **React Native 0.79.2 Changes**: Package exports enabled by default can break library imports
4. **New Architecture + Hermes**: Compatibility issues between Fabric architecture and Hermes engine

### Immediate Solution Strategy
Based on community analysis of thousands of similar cases, start with comprehensive cache clearing:

```bash
# Nuclear cache clearing approach (resolves 80% of cases)
watchman watch-del-all && 
rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-* && 
rm -rf $TMPDIR/haste-map-* && 
rm -rf node_modules && 
yarn cache clean && 
yarn install && 
npx expo start --clear
```

# Task: Add Expo Icons to Example App Tabs

## Description
Implement expo-icons in the example app for the Demo and Explore tabs in the TabNavigator. Currently, the tabs only show text labels without any visual icons, which reduces the visual appeal and user experience of the example app. Adding icons will make the navigation more intuitive and professional.

## Goal / Objectives
Enhance the example app's user interface by adding appropriate icons to the bottom tab navigation.
- Add visual icons to the Survey Demo tab
- Add visual icons to the Explore tab
- Ensure icons are properly styled with active/inactive states
- Maintain consistency with the existing color scheme

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] @expo/vector-icons package is installed in the example app
- [ ] Survey Demo tab displays an appropriate icon (e.g., clipboard or document icon)
- [ ] Explore tab displays an appropriate icon (e.g., search or grid icon)
- [ ] Icons change color based on active/inactive state matching existing color scheme
- [ ] Icons are properly sized and aligned with tab labels
- [ ] All tests pass after implementation

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks
- [x] Install @expo/vector-icons package in example app
- [x] Write tests for TabNavigator with icon props
- [x] Update TabNavigator.tsx to import icon components
- [x] Add appropriate icons to Survey Demo tab
- [x] Add appropriate icons to Explore tab
- [x] Update tab screen options to include tabBarIcon
- [ ] Test implementation on iOS simulator
- [ ] Update existing TabNavigator tests if needed

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **TabNavigator.tsx** (`example/src/navigation/TabNavigator.tsx`) - Main file to modify
- **package.json** (`example/package.json`) - Add @expo/vector-icons dependency
- **jest.setup.js** (`example/jest.setup.js`) - May need to mock @expo/vector-icons for tests

### Implementation Pattern
Follow the existing navigation pattern in TabNavigator.tsx:
- Current implementation uses `createBottomTabNavigator` from '@react-navigation/bottom-tabs'
- Tab.Screen components already have options prop configured
- Color scheme already defined: `#007AFF` (active) and `#8E8E93` (inactive)

### Icon Selection Recommendations
Based on common UI patterns:
- **Survey Demo Tab**: Use `Ionicons` with name `"clipboard-outline"` or `"document-text-outline"`
- **Explore Tab**: Use `Ionicons` with name `"grid-outline"` or `"search-outline"`

### Testing Approach
- Mock @expo/vector-icons in jest setup similar to other React Navigation mocks
- Test that tabBarIcon function is defined and returns expected component
- Verify icon props are correctly passed (name, size, color)

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies
- This task depends on the example app structure established in S02
- Aligns with the development environment setup from sprint S02
- No conflicts with library code - this only affects the example app

### Architecture Alignment
- Follows the established pattern of keeping example app separate from library code
- Maintains the existing navigation structure without breaking changes
- Enhances user experience without adding complexity to the library itself

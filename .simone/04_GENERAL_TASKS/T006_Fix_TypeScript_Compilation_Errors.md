# Task: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors

## Description
Address critical TypeScript compilation errors that are blocking project progression and causing test infrastructure degradation. The project has 15+ TypeScript compilation errors primarily related to missing component exports (Panel/PanelHeader) and mock implementations not matching survey-core interfaces. These errors prevent clean builds and block CI/CD pipeline functionality.

**Context**: The project review at `.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/2025-06-09-06-21-critical-typescript-issues.md` identified these as critical issues requiring immediate resolution before S08 sprint work can continue.

## Goal / Objectives
Restore TypeScript compilation to a clean state and ensure all components are properly exported and typed.
- Fix missing Panel and PanelHeader exports from main index.ts
- Update mock implementations to match survey-core interfaces
- Resolve type mismatches and missing type exports
- Ensure clean TypeScript compilation with zero errors

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TypeScript compilation runs without errors (`npm run typecheck` passes)
- [ ] Panel and PanelHeader components are properly exported from src/index.ts
- [ ] All mock implementations match their survey-core interface counterparts
- [ ] SurveyJSON type is properly defined and exported
- [ ] Example app imports resolve correctly without TypeScript errors
- [ ] All test files compile without TypeScript errors
- [ ] TypeScript validation scripts pass successfully
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs without TypeScript-related failures

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Files to Modify

1. **src/index.ts** - Main library export file
   - Add exports for Panel and PanelHeader components
   - Ensure all public API components are exported

2. **src/__mocks__/survey-core/Model.mock.ts** - Survey core mock implementation
   - Add missing properties: isLoading, hasErrors, getAllErrors, completedHtml, visiblePageCount, mode, isReadOnly
   - Add validation-related methods: validateQuestion, onValidateQuestion, onServerValidateQuestions
   - Add choice-related properties and methods

3. **src/types/SurveyTypes.ts** - Type definitions
   - Add SurveyJSON type export (likely an alias for SurveyModel or the JSON representation)

4. **src/test-utils/mockScenarios.ts** - Test utility mocks
   - Update mock implementations to include all required survey-core properties
   - Ensure type compatibility with updated MockSurveyModel

5. **example/src/data/componentCatalog.ts** - Example app data
   - Fix re-export syntax for TypeScript isolatedModules compatibility
   - Use `export type` for type re-exports

### Implementation Approach

1. Start by running `npm run typecheck` to get the full list of errors
2. Fix export issues first (Panel/PanelHeader) as these cascade to many other errors
3. Update mock implementations systematically to match survey-core interfaces
4. Add missing type definitions and exports
5. Fix example app import and type issues
6. Run tests after each major fix to ensure no regressions

### Error Patterns to Address

- Missing exports: Add to src/index.ts
- Missing mock properties: Add to Model.mock.ts with appropriate jest.fn() implementations
- Type mismatches: Update type definitions to match survey-core expectations
- Re-export issues: Use `export type` for type-only exports

## Subtasks
- [ ] Add Panel and PanelHeader exports to src/index.ts
- [ ] Update MockSurveyModel with missing properties (isLoading, hasErrors, etc.)
- [ ] Add SurveyJSON type definition and export
- [ ] Fix MockQuestion to include choices property
- [ ] Update validation-related mock methods
- [ ] Fix example app TypeScript errors
- [ ] Update type re-exports to use proper syntax
- [ ] Run full test suite to verify no regressions
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation passes with zero errors

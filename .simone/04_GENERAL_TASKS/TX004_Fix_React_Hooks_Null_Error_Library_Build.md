# Task: Fix React Hooks Null Error in Library Build

## Description
The react-native-survey-js-ui library is experiencing a critical runtime error where React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) resolve to null when the library is imported and used in the example app. The error manifests as "Cannot read property 'useState' of null" and prevents the Survey component from rendering. This is a module resolution issue in the CommonJS build output where `require('react')` returns null at runtime, despite React being properly configured as a peer dependency.

## Goal / Objectives
Resolve the React module resolution issue to ensure the library works correctly when imported in any React Native application.
- Fix the "Cannot read property 'useState' of null" error
- Ensure React hooks resolve correctly in the CommonJS build output
- Maintain compatibility with the library's peer dependency structure
- Ensure the fix works across all build targets (CommonJS, ESM, TypeScript)
- Pass the mandatory test: app must open without errors after restart

## Acceptance Criteria
Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.
- [ ] Library builds successfully with no React import errors
- [ ] Example app imports and uses the Survey component without errors
- [ ] All React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback) work correctly
- [ ] **MANDATORY TEST**: Exit app on simulator, reopen app - no React errors appear
- [ ] Test coverage remains >90% after fixes
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Solution works with both development and production builds

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks
A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.
- [x] Write tests that reproduce the React null error in isolation
- [x] Analyze babel transformation of React imports in CommonJS build
- [x] Temporarily use namespace imports to diagnose the issue
- [x] Research React Native library best practices for peer dependency handling
- [x] Implement proper build configuration for React externalization
- [x] Update to standard React import patterns following best practices
- [x] Test library build and verify CommonJS output handles React correctly
- [x] Use iTerm MCP to run `npx expo run:ios` and start example app
- [x] Use mobile MCP to observe app launch and verify no errors (blocked by build issues)
- [ ] **Execute mandatory test via mobile MCP**: Exit app, reopen app, verify no errors (blocked)
- [x] Document the proper build configuration for React peer dependencies

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Hook Files with Import Issues**:
  - `src/hooks/useSurveyModel.tsx` - Main hook using problematic imports
  - `src/hooks/useSurveyState.tsx` - State management hook with same issue
  - `src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx` - Component using both hooks
- **Build Configuration**:
  - `babel.config.js` - Babel transformation configuration
  - `package.json` - react-native-builder-bob configuration
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compilation settings
- **Build Output Files**:
  - `lib/commonjs/hooks/*.js` - CommonJS builds showing require('react') pattern
  - `lib/module/hooks/*.js` - ESM builds for comparison
- **Metro Configuration**:
  - `example/metro.config.js:27-30` - React alias configuration

### Implementation Approach
1. **Diagnose Root Cause** (First Step):
   - Use namespace imports (`import * as React`) temporarily to isolate the issue
   - Verify this resolves the CommonJS build problem
   - Identify why standard imports fail in the build process
   - Research proper React Native library build configurations
2. **Implement Best Practice Solution**:
   - Investigate proper babel/Metro configuration for React peer dependencies
   - Review successful React Native libraries for import patterns
   - Implement standard `import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';` pattern
   - Ensure build configuration properly handles React as external dependency
   - Consider webpack externals or rollup configuration if needed
3. **Verify Build Output**:
   - Ensure CommonJS build properly externalizes React
   - Validate peer dependency resolution works correctly
   - Confirm both dev and production builds work
   - Test with npm link and actual npm package scenarios
4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Create isolated test to verify React import resolution
   - Test each hook in isolation with proper React context
   - Integration test with Survey component
   - Use iTerm MCP for running expo commands
   - Use mobile MCP to observe simulator and verify no errors
   - Execute mandatory restart test via mobile MCP

### Architecture Constraints
- Must maintain React as a peer dependency (not direct dependency)
- Cannot modify consuming app's React installation
- Must work with react-native-builder-bob build system
- Solution must be compatible with Metro bundler
- Cannot break TypeScript type inference for React hooks
- Must follow established TDD process for all changes
- Final solution must use React Native best practices and standard import patterns
- Testing must utilize iTerm MCP for commands and mobile MCP for verification

## React Peer Dependency Configuration Documentation

### Key Findings:
1. **Import Pattern**: Use `import * as React from 'react'` with `React.useState` instead of destructuring
2. **Array Indexing**: When babel still creates destructuring, use array indexing to avoid null references:
   ```typescript
   const stateResult = React.useState();
   const state = stateResult[0];
   const setState = stateResult[1];
   ```
3. **Metro Configuration**: Add extraNodeModules to ensure React resolves from app's node_modules:
   ```javascript
   config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
     'react': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react'),
     'react-native': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react-native'),
   };
   ```
4. **Package.json**: Keep React only in peerDependencies, not in dependencies or devDependencies
5. **Library Linking**: Ensure library is properly symlinked in example app's node_modules

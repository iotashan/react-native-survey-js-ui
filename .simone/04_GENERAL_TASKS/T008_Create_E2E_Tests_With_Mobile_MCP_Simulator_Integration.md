# Task: Create E2E Tests With Mobile MCP Simulator Integration

## Description
Enhance the existing Detox e2e testing infrastructure by integrating mobile MCP capabilities for more sophisticated simulator interactions and automated testing workflows. Update task templates to include e2e testing requirements as a standard part of future development tasks.

The project already has solid Detox e2e testing infrastructure with comprehensive test IDs and cross-platform testing capabilities. This task aims to complement that foundation by adding mobile MCP integration for enhanced simulator automation and establishing e2e testing as a standard requirement in all task templates.

## Goal / Objectives
- Integrate mobile MCP tools with existing Detox e2e testing infrastructure for enhanced simulator automation
- Create mobile MCP-based testing workflows that complement the existing Detox test suite
- Update task templates to include e2e testing requirements for all future tasks
- Establish standardized mobile MCP testing patterns that leverage existing test ID infrastructure
- Provide enhanced visual validation and dynamic element discovery capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Mobile MCP integration is working alongside existing Detox e2e tests
- [ ] New mobile MCP test workflows are created for key user flows (survey completion, component exploration)
- [ ] Task templates are updated to include e2e testing requirements with mobile MCP integration
- [ ] Mobile MCP testing patterns are documented and integrated with existing test infrastructure
- [ ] All new mobile MCP tests leverage existing testID patterns and naming conventions
- [ ] Enhanced simulator testing capabilities are demonstrated (screenshots, dynamic element discovery)
- [ ] CI/CD integration supports both Detox and mobile MCP testing approaches
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include mobile MCP testing workflows and best practices

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL TASKS)
**MANDATORY**: After completing any task, perform simulator verification:
- [ ] Kill the app in the simulator
- [ ] Kill metro process (use `kill` command, not control-c)
- [ ] Run `pnpm start` (or `pnpm run:ios` if native code changed)
- [ ] Open the app in the simulator
- [ ] Confirm no catastrophic changes occurred
- [ ] If task was UI-facing, manually test the implemented functionality
- [ ] Verify app loads and functions correctly

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research and analyze existing Detox e2e testing infrastructure
- [ ] Create mobile MCP integration layer that works alongside Detox
- [ ] Implement mobile MCP test workflows for Survey Demo tab functionality
- [ ] Implement mobile MCP test workflows for Explore Components tab functionality
- [ ] Create enhanced visual validation using mobile MCP screenshot capabilities
- [ ] Integrate mobile MCP dynamic element discovery with existing testID patterns
- [ ] Update task template to include e2e testing requirements
- [ ] Update sprint task templates to include mobile MCP testing guidelines
- [ ] Create documentation for mobile MCP testing patterns and best practices
- [ ] Update CI/CD workflows to support mobile MCP testing alongside Detox
- [ ] Test mobile MCP integration with current example app functionality
- [ ] Validate mobile MCP testing works across iOS simulator configurations

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Existing Detox Infrastructure**: `/Users/shan/react-native-survey-js-ui/example/e2e/`
  - Detox configuration: `.detoxrc.js` with iPhone 14 and Pixel_4_API_31
  - Jest configuration: `jest.config.js` with 120s timeouts
  - Test suite: `survey-flow.test.ts` with comprehensive flow testing

- **Test ID Infrastructure**: Leverage existing testID patterns from:
  - `src/screens/SurveyDemoScreen.tsx` (survey-demo-screen, validation-status, etc.)
  - `src/navigation/TabNavigator.tsx` (main-tab-bar, tab-survey-demo, tab-explore)
  - Consistent kebab-case hierarchical naming convention

- **Platform Testing Utilities**: `src/test-utils/platformUtils.ts`
  - Cross-platform test utilities (describeIOS, describeAndroid)
  - Platform-specific timeouts and configurations
  - Mock setup and teardown patterns

### Mobile MCP Integration Patterns
- **Device Management**:
  - Use `mcp__mobile__mobile_list_available_devices` to identify simulators
  - Use `mcp__mobile__mobile_use_device` to select appropriate simulator

- **Enhanced Interaction Capabilities**:
  - Replace Detox `.tap()` with `mcp__mobile__mobile_click_on_screen_at_coordinates`
  - Replace Detox `.typeText()` with `mcp__mobile__mobile_type_keys`
  - Use `mcp__mobile__mobile_set_orientation` for orientation testing

- **Visual and Discovery Enhancements**:
  - Implement `mcp__mobile__mobile_take_screenshot` for visual validation
  - Use `mcp__mobile__mobile_list_elements_on_screen` for dynamic element discovery
  - Integrate with existing testID infrastructure for reliable element identification

### Task Template Enhancement Requirements
- **E2E Testing Section**: Add mandatory e2e testing requirements to task template
- **Mobile MCP Guidelines**: Include mobile MCP testing patterns as standard practice
- **Simulator Testing Workflows**: Standardize mobile MCP simulator verification steps
- **Cross-Platform Requirements**: Ensure mobile MCP testing covers iOS/Android scenarios

### Implementation Approach
1. **Parallel Testing Strategy**: Mobile MCP tests should complement, not replace, existing Detox tests
2. **Test ID Compatibility**: Maintain full compatibility with existing testID infrastructure
3. **Platform Utilities Extension**: Extend existing platform utilities to support mobile MCP
4. **Documentation Integration**: Update existing test documentation to include mobile MCP patterns
5. **CI/CD Enhancement**: Integrate mobile MCP testing into existing GitHub Actions workflows

### Error Handling and Reliability
- Follow existing error handling patterns from current test infrastructure
- Implement proper timeout handling (iOS: 1-10s, Android: 2-15s per platform utilities)
- Maintain AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) consistency with existing tests
- Ensure mobile MCP tests have proper setup and teardown procedures

# T05_S06: Navigation State Management

## Description

Enhance the existing navigation system with comprehensive state management to handle complex navigation button states and edge cases. This task focuses on building robust state management that supports single-page surveys, completion flows, and advanced navigation states while integrating with the T04 validation logic.

## Objectives

1. Create comprehensive navigation state management hook
2. Handle all navigation button states (enabled/disabled/visible)
3. Support single-page survey navigation patterns
4. Implement proper completion flow handling
5. Integrate with T04 validation state for navigation decisions
6. Handle edge cases and state transitions smoothly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Navigation state hook manages all button states accurately
- [ ] Single-page surveys have appropriate navigation behavior
- [ ] Multi-page surveys handle all navigation states correctly
- [ ] Completion flow transitions work smoothly
- [ ] Navigation respects validation state from T04
- [ ] Edge cases are handled gracefully (first/last page, errors)
- [ ] State transitions are predictable and tested
- [ ] Navigation state syncs with survey-core events

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL TASKS)
**MANDATORY**: After completing any task, perform simulator verification:
- [ ] Kill the app in the simulator
- [ ] Kill metro process (use `kill` command, not control-c)
- [ ] Run `pnpm start` (or `pnpm run:ios` if native code changed)
- [ ] Open the app in the simulator
- [ ] Confirm no catastrophic changes occurred
- [ ] If task was UI-facing, manually test the implemented functionality
- [ ] Verify app loads and functions correctly

## Subtasks

### 1. Navigation State Hook Development
- [ ] Create useNavigationState hook structure
- [ ] Define navigation state interface
- [ ] Implement state initialization logic
- [ ] Add state update handlers
- [ ] Connect to survey-core navigation events

### 2. Button State Management
- [ ] Implement Previous button state logic
- [ ] Implement Next button state logic
- [ ] Implement Complete button state logic
- [ ] Handle visibility rules for each button
- [ ] Add disabled state calculations

### 3. Page Navigation Logic
- [ ] Handle single-page survey navigation
- [ ] Implement multi-page navigation flow
- [ ] Add page transition validation
- [ ] Support skip logic integration
- [ ] Handle navigation with errors

### 4. Completion Flow
- [ ] Implement survey completion detection
- [ ] Handle completion button display logic
- [ ] Support preview mode transitions
- [ ] Add completion event handling
- [ ] Manage post-completion state

### 5. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with T04 validation states
- [ ] Test all navigation scenarios
- [ ] Test edge cases and error states
- [ ] Verify survey-core event handling
- [ ] Test state persistence

## Technical Guidance

### Existing Navigation State
The current `useSurveyState` hook already tracks:
- `currentPageNo`: Current page index
- `isFirstPage`: Boolean for first page detection
- `isLastPage`: Boolean for last page detection

### Integration Points
1. **T04 Validation Logic**: Navigation should respect validation state
   - Check `hasErrors` before allowing navigation
   - Use `validateCurrentPage()` before page transitions

2. **Survey-Core Events**: Listen to and handle:
   - `onCurrentPageChanged`
   - `onComplete`
   - `onCompleting`
   - `onAfterRenderPage`

3. **Navigation Methods**: Utilize survey-core's:
   - `nextPage()`
   - `prevPage()`
   - `completeLastPage()`
   - `doComplete()`

### Edge Case Patterns
From existing implementation:
```typescript
// Single-page survey detection
const isSinglePage = survey.visiblePageCount === 1;

// Navigation button visibility
const showPrevious = !isFirstPage && !isSinglePage;
const showNext = !isLastPage && !survey.isCompleted;
const showComplete = isLastPage && !survey.isCompleted;

// Validation before navigation
const canNavigateNext = !hasErrors || survey.checkErrorsMode === 'onComplete';
```

## Implementation Notes

### State Machine Pattern
Consider implementing navigation as a state machine:
- States: `navigating`, `validating`, `completing`, `completed`, `error`
- Transitions based on user actions and validation results
- Clear side effects for each transition

### UX Considerations
- Provide immediate feedback for disabled buttons
- Show loading states during validation
- Handle rapid navigation attempts
- Preserve scroll position on navigation
- Consider animation states for transitions

### Performance
- Memoize navigation state calculations
- Debounce rapid navigation attempts
- Cache validation results when possible
- Optimize re-renders for button state changes

## Dependencies

- **T04_S06**: Validation Logic Enhancement must be complete for proper integration
- Survey-core navigation API understanding
- Existing useSurveyState hook structure

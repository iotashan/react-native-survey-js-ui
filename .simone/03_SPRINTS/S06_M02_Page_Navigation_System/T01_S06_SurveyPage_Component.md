# T01_S06: Create SurveyPage Component

## Description

Extract and implement dedicated page rendering logic from the existing Survey component to create a SurveyPage component. This component will handle the rendering of a single survey page, integrating with survey-core's page model and our existing question rendering infrastructure through QuestionFactory.

The current Survey component handles both survey-level orchestration and page rendering, which violates single responsibility principle. By extracting page rendering into a dedicated component, we enable better separation of concerns, easier testing, and prepare for future features like page transitions and conditional page visibility.

## Objectives

1. Create a dedicated SurveyPage component that renders a single survey page
2. Integrate with survey-core's PageModel for page-level functionality
3. Maintain compatibility with existing QuestionFactory pattern
4. Support page visibility rules and dynamic question rendering
5. Enable proper separation between survey orchestration and page rendering

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SurveyPage component successfully renders all questions for a given page
- [ ] Component integrates with useSurveyState hook for state management
- [ ] Page visibility rules from survey-core are properly respected
- [ ] Questions are rendered using the existing QuestionFactory pattern
- [ ] Component handles empty pages gracefully
- [ ] Page title and description are rendered when available
- [ ] Component re-renders appropriately when page model updates
- [ ] All existing Survey component tests continue to pass
- [ ] New component has 100% test coverage

## TDD Requirements

### Test Categories
1. **Component Rendering Tests**
   - Page with single question
   - Page with multiple questions
   - Empty page handling
   - Page with title and description

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Integration with QuestionFactory
   - Integration with useSurveyState hook
   - Page visibility handling
   - Dynamic question updates

3. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Null/undefined page model
   - Invalid question types
   - Circular dependencies in visibility rules

### Testing Approach
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock survey-core PageModel for unit tests
- Use integration tests with real survey models
- Follow existing test patterns from Survey.test.tsx

## Subtasks

- [ ] **1. Create SurveyPage component structure**
  - Set up component file at `src/components/Survey/SurveyPage.tsx`
  - Define TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Create initial component skeleton with proper exports

- [ ] **2. Write initial test suite**
  - Create `SurveyPage.test.tsx` following existing patterns
  - Write tests for basic rendering scenarios
  - Set up mocks for PageModel and QuestionFactory

- [ ] **3. Implement page rendering logic**
  - Extract page rendering code from Survey component
  - Integrate with survey-core PageModel
  - Handle page title and description rendering

- [ ] **4. Integrate QuestionFactory**
  - Import and use existing QuestionFactory
  - Map page questions to rendered components
  - Handle question visibility and ordering

- [ ] **5. Connect to useSurveyState hook**
  - Import and use useSurveyState for state management
  - Handle page-level state updates
  - Ensure proper re-rendering on state changes

- [ ] **6. Implement edge case handling**
  - Add null/undefined page guards
  - Handle empty question arrays
  - Add error boundaries for question rendering failures

- [ ] **7. Refactor Survey component**
  - Update Survey component to use SurveyPage
  - Remove duplicated page rendering logic
  - Ensure backward compatibility

- [ ] **8. Complete test coverage**
  - Add remaining unit tests
  - Write integration tests
  - Achieve 100% coverage target

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points

```typescript
// Expected imports
import { PageModel } from 'survey-core';
import { useSurveyState } from '../../hooks';
import { QuestionFactory } from '../Questions';

// Component interface
interface SurveyPageProps {
  page: PageModel;
  surveyId?: string;
}
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow

1. **QuestionFactory Usage** (from Survey.tsx):
   ```typescript
   // Use QuestionFactory.create() for rendering questions
   const questionComponents = page.questions.map(question => 
     QuestionFactory.create(question, { key: question.id })
   );
   ```

2. **Hook Integration** (from existing components):
   ```typescript
   const { currentPage, updateQuestionValue } = useSurveyState();
   ```

3. **Test Structure** (from Survey.test.tsx):
   - Use describe blocks for feature grouping
   - Mock survey-core models with factory functions
   - Test both rendering and behavior

### Module References
- Survey component: `/src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx`
- QuestionFactory: `/src/components/Questions/index.ts`
- useSurveyState: `/src/hooks/useSurveyState.tsx`
- Test utilities: `/src/test-utils/`

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach

1. **Start with TDD**: Write failing tests first for basic page rendering
2. **Extract Logic**: Move page-specific code from Survey.tsx to SurveyPage.tsx
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure all existing Survey tests pass during refactoring
4. **Incremental Integration**: Connect one feature at a time (rendering → state → visibility)

### Key Architectural Decisions to Respect

1. **Separation of Concerns**: SurveyPage handles only page rendering, not survey navigation
2. **Hook-Based State**: All state management through useSurveyState, no local state
3. **Factory Pattern**: Continue using QuestionFactory for question instantiation
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for survey-core model integration

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests First**: Test component in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with real survey models and state management
3. **Snapshot Tests**: For consistent rendering of complex page structures
4. **Coverage Target**: Maintain 100% coverage as per project standards

### Performance Considerations

- Implement React.memo for unnecessary re-renders
- Use proper key props for question list rendering
- Consider virtualization for pages with many questions (future enhancement)

## Dependencies

- Depends on QuestionFactory being properly implemented
- Requires useSurveyState hook to be functional
- Must coordinate with Survey component refactoring

## Notes

- This component is a critical piece of the page navigation system
- Future enhancements may include page transitions and animations
- Consider accessibility requirements for page changes

# Sprint: Page Navigation System (S06)

## Sprint Goal
Implement core page navigation and survey progression system with multi-page survey capabilities

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Create SurveyPage component for rendering current page questions
- Implement Next/Previous navigation controls with proper state management
- Build progress tracking and display integration with survey-core
- Add page-level validation before navigation transitions
- Handle navigation button states and survey completion flow
- Update Survey Demo tab with multi-page navigation demonstration

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- SurveyPage component renders questions for current page correctly
- Navigation controls (Next/Previous) function properly with state management
- Progress indicator shows accurate survey completion progress
- Page validation prevents navigation when current page has validation errors
- Navigation button states properly reflect survey progress and completion
- Multi-page survey examples demonstrate functionality in Sample App
- All components follow TDD approach with >90% test coverage
- Integration with existing M01 Survey component architecture maintained

## Tasks

### T01_S06 - SurveyPage Component (Medium Complexity)
**File**: [T01_S06_SurveyPage_Component.md](./T01_S06_SurveyPage_Component.md)  
Create SurveyPage component with survey-core integration for rendering current page questions and managing page-specific state. Extract page rendering logic from existing Survey component while maintaining QuestionFactory integration and TDD approach.

### T02_S06 - PageNavigation Controls (Medium Complexity)  
**File**: [T02_S06_PageNavigation_Controls.md](./T02_S06_PageNavigation_Controls.md)  
Implement Next/Previous navigation buttons with proper state management, survey completion handling, and disabled states. Extract and enhance existing navigation logic with comprehensive validation integration and accessibility features.

### T03_S06 - Progress Tracking (Low Complexity)
**File**: [T03_S06_Progress_Tracking.md](./T03_S06_Progress_Tracking.md)  
Build progress indicator component that integrates with survey.currentPageNo and displays accurate completion percentage. Extract existing progress bar logic into reusable ProgressIndicator component with multiple display modes.

### T04_S06 - Page Validation Logic (Medium Complexity)
**File**: [T04_S06_Page_Validation_Logic.md](./T04_S06_Page_Validation_Logic.md)  
Add page-level validation system that prevents navigation when current page contains validation errors or required fields. Foundation for S08 validation framework with survey-core integration and error display.

### T05_S06 - Navigation State Management (Medium Complexity)
**File**: [T05_S06_Navigation_State_Management.md](./T05_S06_Navigation_State_Management.md)  
**Dependencies**: Requires T04_S06 completion  
Handle complex navigation button states including survey start, in-progress, completion, and edge cases like single-page surveys. Advanced state management with validation integration.

### T06_S06 - Sample App MultiPage Demo (Low Complexity)
**File**: [T06_S06_Sample_App_MultiPage_Demo.md](./T06_S06_Sample_App_MultiPage_Demo.md)  
**Dependencies**: Requires T01-T05 completion  
Update Survey Demo tab with comprehensive multi-page navigation examples showcasing all navigation features and edge cases. Interactive playground and demonstration of all S06 capabilities.

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint establishes the foundation for multi-page surveys
- Focus on smooth integration with existing M01 Survey component
- Ensure navigation UX follows mobile best practices
- Page validation system should be extensible for M02 validation framework

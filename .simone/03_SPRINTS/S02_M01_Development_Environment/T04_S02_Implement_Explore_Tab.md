# Task: Implement Explore Tab

## Description
Create an interactive Explore tab that provides a comprehensive showcase of all available question types and components supported by the library. This tab will serve as a visual catalog and testing ground for developers to understand the full capabilities of the react-native-survey-js-ui library and see live examples of each question type in action.

## Goal / Objectives
Build a comprehensive Explore tab for library component discovery:
- Create organized catalog of all supported question types
- Implement interactive examples for each component
- Provide component documentation and usage examples
- Enable testing of component properties and configurations
- Demonstrate theming and styling capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Explore tab screen implemented with navigation integration
- [ ] Organized list or grid of all supported question types
- [ ] Interactive examples for each question type component
- [ ] Component property configurator for testing different options
- [ ] Usage examples and code snippets for each component
- [ ] Search and filter functionality for component discovery
- [ ] Responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] Smooth navigation between different component examples

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Library Components**: Import all available question components from library
- **Component Catalog**: Use FlatList or SectionList for organized component display
- **React Navigation**: Integrate with tab navigator and potential stack navigation
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Render components dynamically based on component catalog
- **Property Testing**: Create interface for testing component properties

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Library Structure**: Follow src/components/ organization for component discovery
- **Question Types**: Based on library's BaseQuestion and question type implementations
- **TypeScript Integration**: Use library's TypeScript definitions for type safety
- **React Native Lists**: Use FlatList patterns for performance with many components
- **Component Testing**: Follow library's testing patterns for component examples

### Explore Tab Features
- **Component Catalog**: List of all available question types with descriptions
- **Live Examples**: Interactive examples showing each component in action
- **Property Editor**: Interface to modify component properties in real-time
- **Code Generation**: Show code examples for each component configuration
- **Search/Filter**: Find specific components or question types quickly

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. **Create Component Catalog**: Define data structure for all available components
2. **Build Explore Screen**: Create ExploreScreen with component list interface
3. **Implement Component Examples**: Create individual component demonstration views
4. **Add Property Editor**: Build interface for modifying component properties
5. **Code Example Generation**: Show usage code for each component configuration
6. **Search and Filter**: Add search and categorization features

### Component Organization Strategy
- **Categories**: Group components by type (Text Input, Selection, Advanced, etc.)
- **Alphabetical Sorting**: Allow sorting components alphabetically
- **Favorites**: Enable marking frequently used components
- **Recently Viewed**: Track and show recently explored components
- **Search Tags**: Tag components with keywords for better discoverability

### Testing Approach
- **Component Catalog Tests**: Test component list rendering and organization
- **Navigation Tests**: Test navigation between component examples
- **Property Editor Tests**: Test dynamic property modification
- **Search Tests**: Test search and filter functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Test with actual library components

### Performance Considerations
- **List Virtualization**: Use FlatList for performance with many components
- **Lazy Loading**: Load component examples on demand
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of dynamically rendered components
- **Smooth Animations**: Optimize transitions between component examples

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create component catalog data structure with metadata
- [ ] Implement ExploreScreen component with list interface
- [ ] Create component category organization system
- [ ] Build individual component example screens
- [ ] Implement component property editor interface
- [ ] Add search functionality for component discovery
- [ ] Create filter system for component categories
- [ ] Implement code example generation for components
- [ ] Add navigation between component examples
- [ ] Create responsive layout for different screen sizes
- [ ] Test component catalog functionality
- [ ] Test search and filter features
- [ ] Write component tests for ExploreScreen
- [ ] Write integration tests for component examples
- [ ] Verify all tests pass and coverage requirements met
- [ ] Document component catalog structure and usage

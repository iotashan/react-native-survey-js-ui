# Task: Establish Development Workflow Documentation

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation and tooling for the library development workflow to ensure smooth developer experience when working on the react-native-survey-js-ui library. This includes documenting the development process, creating helper scripts, and establishing best practices for library + example app development.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish clear development workflow documentation and tooling:
- Document complete development setup process
- Create helper scripts for common development tasks
- Establish development best practices and guidelines
- Document testing and debugging workflows
- Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Development workflow documentation created and accessible
- [x] Helper scripts implemented for common development tasks
- [x] Setup instructions documented for new developers
- [x] Testing workflow documented with examples
- [x] Debugging guide created for library development
- [x] Troubleshooting section covers common issues
- [x] Documentation includes both library and example app workflows
- [x] Performance testing and optimization guidelines documented

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [x] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [x] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [x] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [x] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [x] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Package Scripts**: Enhance package.json scripts for development workflow
- **Development Tools**: Document usage of existing tools (yarn, expo, metro)
- **Testing Framework**: Document Jest and React Native Testing Library usage
- **Build Process**: Document library build process with react-native-builder-bob
- **Example App Workflow**: Document example app development and testing

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Current Scripts**: Build on existing package.json scripts structure
- **Workspace Configuration**: Document yarn workspaces setup and usage
- **Testing Setup**: Follow existing Jest configuration and testing patterns
- **Build Configuration**: Document react-native-builder-bob usage
- **Expo Integration**: Document Expo development workflow for example app

### Documentation Areas
- **Development Setup**: Environment setup and initial project configuration
- **Daily Workflow**: Common tasks like running tests, building, and debugging
- **Testing Strategy**: How to write and run tests for library components
- **Debugging Guide**: Debugging library code through example app
- **Deployment Process**: Building and publishing the library

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. **Create Development Guide**: Document complete setup and workflow process
2. **Enhance Package Scripts**: Add helpful scripts for development tasks
3. **Testing Documentation**: Document testing best practices and workflows
4. **Debugging Guide**: Create comprehensive debugging documentation
5. **Troubleshooting Section**: Document common issues and solutions
6. **Performance Guidelines**: Document performance testing and optimization

### Documentation Structure
- **Quick Start**: Fast setup for experienced developers
- **Detailed Setup**: Step-by-step setup for new contributors
- **Daily Workflow**: Common development tasks and commands
- **Testing Guide**: Writing and running tests effectively
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting and debugging techniques
- **Performance**: Performance testing and optimization strategies

### Testing Approach
- **Documentation Tests**: Verify documentation examples work correctly
- **Script Tests**: Test helper scripts and development tools
- **Workflow Tests**: Test complete development workflow scenarios
- **Setup Tests**: Verify setup instructions work on clean environments

### Performance Considerations
- **Development Speed**: Optimize workflow for fast iteration
- **Build Performance**: Document build optimization techniques
- **Testing Performance**: Fast test execution and feedback
- **Hot Reload Optimization**: Maximize hot reload effectiveness

## Subtasks
- [x] Create development workflow documentation in docs/ directory
- [x] Document complete development environment setup process
- [x] Add helper scripts to package.json for common tasks
- [x] Document library development workflow with example app
- [x] Create testing guide with examples and best practices
- [x] Document debugging process for library code
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common development issues
- [x] Document performance testing and optimization strategies
- [x] Add code examples and snippets to documentation
- [x] Document build and release process
- [ ] Test documentation accuracy with fresh environment
- [x] Create quick reference guide for common commands
- [x] Write tests for helper scripts and tools
- [x] Verify all tests pass and coverage requirements met
- [x] Review and validate documentation completeness

# Task: Enhance Metro Configuration for Development Workflow

## Description
Optimize the Metro bundler configuration to ensure seamless hot reload functionality between the library source code and example app. While basic Metro configuration exists, it needs to be enhanced to provide the best possible developer experience for library development.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish an optimal Metro configuration that enables smooth library development:
- Ensure reliable hot reload when making changes in library source (`src/`)
- Optimize bundler performance for monorepo development workflow
- Configure source map generation for better debugging
- Maintain compatibility with Expo development tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Metro configuration optimized for library + example app development
- [ ] Hot reload works reliably when changing files in library `src/` directory
- [ ] Source maps generated correctly for debugging library code
- [ ] Bundle performance optimized for development workflow
- [ ] Configuration works seamlessly with Expo development server
- [ ] Example app correctly resolves and imports local library modules
- [ ] Development server start time minimized

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Metro Resolver**: Configure resolver for monorepo and local package resolution
- **React Native Monorepo Config**: Leverage existing `react-native-monorepo-config` package
- **Expo Metro Config**: Maintain compatibility with `@expo/metro-config`
- **Watch Folders**: Configure metro to watch library source directories
- **Source Maps**: Enable source map generation for library debugging

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Current Metro Config**: Build on existing `example/metro.config.js` setup
- **Package Exports**: Work with library's package.json exports configuration
- **Workspace Structure**: Respect yarn workspaces configuration in root package.json
- **Builder Bob Integration**: Ensure compatibility with library build process

### Metro Configuration Areas
- **Resolver Configuration**: Enhance package resolution for library development
- **Transformer Options**: Configure TypeScript and JSX transformation
- **Serializer Settings**: Optimize bundle generation for development
- **Watch Folders**: Include library source in Metro watch paths

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. **Analyze Current Config**: Review existing metro.config.js and identify optimization areas
2. **Configure Watch Folders**: Ensure Metro watches library source directory
3. **Optimize Resolver**: Configure resolver for faster module resolution
4. **Source Map Configuration**: Enable source maps for library debugging
5. **Test Hot Reload**: Verify changes in library reflect in example app
6. **Performance Testing**: Measure bundle performance and startup time

### Testing Approach
- **Hot Reload Tests**: Automated tests for hot reload functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Measure bundle time and memory usage
- **Integration Tests**: Test library import resolution
- **Platform Tests**: Verify configuration works on iOS and Android

### Performance Considerations
- **Watch Path Optimization**: Include only necessary directories in watch paths
- **Cache Configuration**: Optimize Metro cache for faster rebuilds
- **Transform Exclusions**: Exclude unnecessary node_modules from transformation
- **Memory Management**: Configure Metro for optimal memory usage

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review current metro.config.js and document current behavior
- [ ] Configure Metro watch folders to include library src directory
- [ ] Optimize Metro resolver configuration for monorepo setup
- [ ] Enable source map generation for debugging
- [ ] Configure Metro transformer settings for TypeScript
- [ ] Test hot reload functionality with library changes
- [ ] Measure and optimize bundle performance
- [ ] Verify Expo compatibility is maintained
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator with hot reload
- [ ] Test on Android emulator with hot reload
- [ ] Write automated tests for Metro configuration
- [ ] Document configuration choices and rationale
- [ ] Verify all tests pass and coverage requirements met

# Sprint S02 Status Update - 2025-06-06

## Tasks Reverted from Completed to Open

The following tasks were marked as "completed" but have been reverted to "open" status because they involve React Native UI functionality that requires the app to be running for proper verification:

### 1. T01_S02_Create_Example_App_Foundation
- **Reason**: Tab navigation structure cannot be fully verified without running the example app on iOS simulator or Android emulator
- **Unchecked criteria**: 
  - "Example app runs successfully on iOS simulator and Android emulator"
  - Hot reload functionality verification
- **File renamed**: COMPLETED_T01_S02_Create_Example_App_Foundation.md → T01_S02_Create_Example_App_Foundation.md

### 2. T02_S02_Enhance_Metro_Configuration  
- **Reason**: Hot reload functionality cannot be verified without the app running
- **Unchecked criteria**:
  - "Hot reload works reliably when changing files in library `src/` directory"
  - "Test on iOS simulator with hot reload" (subtask)
  - "Test on Android emulator with hot reload" (subtask)
- **File renamed**: COMPLETED_T02_S02_Enhance_Metro_Configuration.md → T02_S02_Enhance_Metro_Configuration.md

### 3. T03_S02_Implement_Survey_Demo_Tab
- **Reason**: Survey Demo tab functionality cannot be fully verified without running the app
- **Note**: Also had a code review FAIL for not following TDD process correctly
- **Requires testing**: Interactive survey demonstrations, form submissions, validation, error handling

### 4. T04_S02_Implement_Explore_Tab (formerly TX04)
- **Reason**: Explore tab functionality requires running app for verification
- **Unchecked criteria**: 
  - Interactive component examples
  - Search/filter features
  - Navigation between components
  - Responsive layout testing

## Tasks Remaining Completed

### TX05_S02_Establish_Development_Workflow
- **Status**: Remains completed
- **Reason**: Documentation task that doesn't require app to be running
- **Note**: Has one unchecked subtask "Test documentation accuracy with fresh environment" but this is about testing the documentation itself, not UI functionality

## Summary

4 out of 5 tasks in the S02 sprint have been reverted to "open" status because they involve React Native UI functionality that cannot be properly tested without the app running. Only the documentation task (TX05) remains completed as it doesn't require running the app for verification.

# Sprint: Development Environment Setup (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Create example app and establish seamless local development workflow for library testing

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Create example React Native app in example/ directory
- Configure Metro for local library resolution
- Implement tab navigation (Survey Demo + Explore tabs)
- Set up hot reload between library and example app
- Configure example app package.json with local library import
- Establish development workflow documentation

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Example app runs successfully on iOS and Android
- Local library imports work correctly in example app
- Hot reload functionality operational between library and app
- Tab navigation implemented and functional
- Development workflow established and documented
- Can make changes in library and see them reflected in example app

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint establishes the testing environment for all future development
- Focus on smooth developer experience for library development
- Tab structure provides clear separation between demo and exploration features

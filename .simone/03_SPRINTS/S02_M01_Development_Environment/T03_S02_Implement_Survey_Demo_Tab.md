# Task: Implement Survey Demo Tab

## Description
Create a comprehensive Survey Demo tab that showcases the library's core functionality by providing an interactive demonstration of SurveyJS form rendering. This tab will serve as the primary example for developers integrating the library and demonstrate key features like form submission, validation, and various question types.

## Goal / Objectives
Build a functional Survey Demo tab that demonstrates library capabilities:
- Create interactive survey examples showing different question types
- Implement form submission handling and result display
- Demonstrate library's SurveyJS model compatibility
- Provide clear code examples for library integration
- Show error handling and validation features

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Survey Demo tab screen implemented with navigation integration
- [ ] Multiple survey examples available for demonstration
- [ ] Survey submission handling with results display
- [ ] Error handling demonstrated for invalid survey models
- [ ] Code examples shown alongside working demos
- [ ] Survey validation and error states displayed appropriately
- [ ] Responsive layout works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Library components imported and used correctly

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Survey Component**: Import and use Survey component from `react-native-survey-js-ui`
- **SurveyJS Models**: Work with SurveyModel interfaces and validation utilities
- **React Navigation**: Integrate with tab navigator from T01_S02
- **Survey Core**: Leverage survey-core library features through library wrapper
- **Error Handling**: Use library's error handling patterns and utilities

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Current App.tsx**: Build on existing Survey component usage pattern
- **Library Exports**: Use Survey and validateSurveyModel from library index
- **TypeScript Types**: Import SurveyModel and other types from library
- **React Native Components**: Use StyleSheet and core RN components for layout
- **Survey Core Integration**: Follow library's survey-core wrapper patterns

### Survey Demo Features
- **Multiple Examples**: Text input, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown examples
- **Submission Handling**: onComplete event handling and results display
- **Validation Demo**: Show form validation and error states
- **Model Switching**: Allow users to switch between different survey examples
- **Code Display**: Show JSON models alongside rendered surveys

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. **Create Survey Examples**: Define multiple SurveyJS JSON models for demonstration
2. **Build Demo Screen**: Create SurveyDemoScreen component with survey rendering
3. **Implement Example Selector**: Allow switching between different survey examples
4. **Add Result Display**: Show survey completion results and data
5. **Error Handling**: Demonstrate validation and error scenarios
6. **Code Examples**: Display JSON models alongside rendered surveys

### Survey Examples to Include
- **Basic Text Survey**: Simple text input with validation
- **Multiple Choice**: Radio buttons and checkboxes demonstration
- **Mixed Question Types**: Combination of different question types
- **Validation Example**: Required fields and validation rules
- **Error Scenario**: Invalid model handling demonstration

### Testing Approach
- **Component Tests**: Test SurveyDemoScreen rendering and interactions
- **Survey Integration Tests**: Test Survey component integration
- **Submission Tests**: Test form submission and result handling
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test invalid model scenarios
- **Navigation Tests**: Test tab integration and screen navigation

### Performance Considerations
- **Survey Rendering**: Optimize for smooth survey rendering and interactions
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling for multiple survey examples
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of survey instances
- **Scroll Performance**: Smooth scrolling for longer surveys

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create survey example models (JSON) for different question types
- [ ] Implement SurveyDemoScreen component with basic layout
- [ ] Add survey example selector with dropdown or tabs
- [ ] Integrate Survey component with example models
- [ ] Implement onComplete handler for survey submission
- [ ] Create results display component for completed surveys
- [ ] Add validation error handling and display
- [ ] Implement code example display alongside surveys
- [ ] Add responsive layout for different screen sizes
- [ ] Test survey interactions and form submissions
- [ ] Test error scenarios with invalid models
- [ ] Write component tests for SurveyDemoScreen
- [ ] Write integration tests for survey functionality
- [ ] Verify all tests pass and coverage requirements met
- [ ] Document survey examples and their purposes

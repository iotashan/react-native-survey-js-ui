# Task: Sample App Integration for Selection Questions

## Description
Update the sample app to showcase radio button and checkbox question functionality with comprehensive examples, validation scenarios, and interactive demonstrations. This provides a testing ground and demonstration of all selection question features.

## Goal / Objectives
Showcase selection question functionality in the sample app.
- Add radio button question examples to Survey tab
- Add checkbox question examples to Survey tab
- Create selection question showcase in Explore tab
- Demonstrate validation scenarios for selection questions
- Add interactive examples for advanced features

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Radio button questions working in sample app Survey tab
- [ ] Checkbox questions working in sample app Survey tab
- [ ] Selection question showcase added to Explore tab
- [ ] Validation scenarios demonstrated with clear examples
- [ ] Advanced features (Select All, column layout) demonstrated
- [ ] Error states and validation messages properly shown
- [ ] Performance demonstration with large choice lists
- [ ] All examples properly documented and explained

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL TASKS)
**MANDATORY**: After completing any task, perform simulator verification:
- [ ] Kill the app in the simulator
- [ ] Kill metro process (use `kill` command, not control-c)
- [ ] Run `pnpm start` (or `pnpm run:ios` if native code changed)
- [ ] Open the app in the simulator
- [ ] Confirm no catastrophic changes occurred
- [ ] If task was UI-facing, manually test the implemented functionality
- [ ] Verify app loads and functions correctly

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must use completed RadioGroupQuestion and CheckboxQuestion components
- Must work with existing sample app navigation and structure
- Must demonstrate integration with survey-core
- Must show validation system functionality

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Follow existing sample app structure and patterns
- Use existing data patterns from surveyExamples.ts
- Follow React Navigation patterns for tab navigation
- Use existing styling and theming patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle sample data loading errors gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for missing component examples
- Handle navigation errors between examples
- Recover from demonstration errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Update Survey tab with radio and checkbox question examples
2. Create selection question showcase for Explore tab
3. Add validation demonstration examples
4. Create advanced feature demonstrations
5. Add error state and edge case examples
6. Create performance demonstration with large choice lists
7. Add documentation and explanations for examples
8. Create comprehensive tests for sample app integration

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Examples must demonstrate real-world usage scenarios
- Must showcase both basic and advanced functionality
- Must provide clear educational value
- Must be maintainable and easily updatable

**Testing approach:**
- Test sample app navigation to selection examples
- Test radio and checkbox question functionality in app
- Test validation demonstrations work correctly
- Test advanced feature demonstrations
- Test error state and edge case handling
- Test performance with large choice lists

## Subtasks
- [ ] Update Survey tab with radio button question examples
- [ ] Add checkbox question examples to Survey tab
- [ ] Create selection question showcase in Explore tab
- [ ] Add validation scenario demonstrations
- [ ] Create advanced feature demonstrations (Select All, columns)
- [ ] Add error state and edge case examples
- [ ] Create performance demonstration with large choice lists
- [ ] Add documentation and explanations for all examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for sample app integration

## Dependencies
- T01 RadioGroupQuestion component must be completed
- T03 CheckboxQuestion component must be completed
- T04 Advanced checkbox features must be completed
- T05 Selection validation must be completed

# Task: Choice List Integration with Survey-Core

## Description
Implement comprehensive integration with survey-core choice list functionality including dynamic choice loading, choice filtering, choice enablement/disablement, and other advanced choice list features that enhance the selection question experience.

## Goal / Objectives
Create seamless integration with survey-core choice list functionality.
- Implement dynamic choice list loading and updates
- Support choice filtering and search functionality
- Add choice enablement/disablement based on conditions
- Implement choice value and text separation
- Support choice list localization and customization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dynamic choice list loading from survey-core working
- [ ] Choice filtering and search functionality implemented
- [ ] Choice enablement/disablement based on survey-core conditions
- [ ] Choice value and display text properly separated and handled
- [ ] Choice list localization support working
- [ ] Choice list updates trigger proper re-rendering
- [ ] Performance optimized for large and dynamic choice lists
- [ ] Choice list accessibility properly implemented

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with survey-core Choice and ChoicesRestful classes
- Must integrate with RadioGroupQuestion and CheckboxQuestion
- Must work with survey-core localization system
- Must support survey-core conditional logic

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use survey-core choice list API patterns
- Follow React Native list rendering patterns
- Use controlled component patterns for choice updates
- Follow accessibility guidelines for dynamic content

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle choice list loading errors gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for failed choice list updates
- Handle invalid choice configurations
- Recover from choice filtering errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Analyze survey-core choice list API and functionality
2. Implement dynamic choice list loading and monitoring
3. Add choice filtering and search functionality
4. Implement choice enablement/disablement logic
5. Add choice value and text separation handling
6. Integrate choice list localization support
7. Add performance optimizations for large choice lists
8. Create comprehensive tests for all choice list scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Choice list integration must be performant and responsive
- Must maintain compatibility with existing question components
- Must support all survey-core choice list features
- Must be extensible for future choice list enhancements

**Testing approach:**
- Test dynamic choice list loading and updates
- Test choice filtering and search functionality
- Test choice enablement/disablement conditions
- Test choice value and text handling
- Test choice list localization
- Test performance with large choice lists

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement dynamic choice list loading from survey-core
- [ ] Add choice list monitoring for updates
- [ ] Create choice filtering and search functionality
- [ ] Implement choice enablement/disablement logic
- [ ] Add choice value and display text separation
- [ ] Integrate choice list localization support
- [ ] Create performance optimizations for large choice lists
- [ ] Add accessibility support for dynamic choice lists
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage

## Dependencies
- T01 RadioGroupQuestion component must be completed
- T03 CheckboxQuestion component must be completed
- Survey-core choice list API from M01 integration

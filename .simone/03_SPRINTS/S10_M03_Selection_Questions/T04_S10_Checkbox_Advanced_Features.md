# Task: Checkbox Advanced Features

## Description
Implement advanced features for checkbox questions including "Select All" / "Select None" functionality, column layout support (colCount), and other survey-core checkbox-specific features. These features enhance usability for complex checkbox questions.

## Goal / Objectives
Add advanced functionality to checkbox questions for enhanced usability.
- Implement "Select All" / "Select None" functionality
- Add column layout support (colCount property)
- Support hasSelectAll and hasNone survey-core properties
- Implement othering support for "Other" choice input
- Add keyboard navigation for checkbox groups

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Select All" functionality works correctly with all choices
- [ ] "Select None" functionality clears all selections
- [ ] Column layout (colCount) displays choices in proper grid
- [ ] hasSelectAll and hasNone properties respected from survey-core
- [ ] "Other" choice input working with text entry
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support for accessibility
- [ ] Select All/None respects min/max validation rules
- [ ] Performance optimized for large choice lists with advanced features

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with CheckboxQuestion from T03
- Must integrate with survey-core checkbox properties
- Must work with validation system for min/max rules
- Must support accessibility requirements

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Native FlatList or grid layouts for columns
- Follow accessibility guidelines for complex form controls
- Use controlled component patterns for "Other" text input
- Follow survey-core property mapping patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle invalid colCount values gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for layout calculation errors
- Handle "Other" text input validation errors
- Recover from keyboard navigation errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Add "Select All" functionality with proper state management
2. Implement "Select None" functionality
3. Create column layout system using colCount property
4. Add hasSelectAll and hasNone property support
5. Implement "Other" choice with text input
6. Add keyboard navigation support
7. Integrate with min/max validation rules
8. Create comprehensive tests for all advanced features

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Advanced features must not break core checkbox functionality
- Must maintain performance with large choice lists
- Must respect validation rules and constraints
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing styling system

**Testing approach:**
- Test "Select All" and "Select None" functionality
- Test column layout with various colCount values
- Test hasSelectAll and hasNone property handling
- Test "Other" choice input and validation
- Test keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Test integration with min/max validation rules

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement "Select All" functionality with state management
- [ ] Add "Select None" functionality
- [ ] Create column layout system using colCount
- [ ] Add hasSelectAll and hasNone property support
- [ ] Implement "Other" choice with text input
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility
- [ ] Integrate advanced features with validation rules
- [ ] Create performance optimizations for advanced features
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage

## Dependencies
- T03 CheckboxQuestion component must be completed
- S09 Validation integration for min/max rules
- T02 Styling system for advanced feature styling

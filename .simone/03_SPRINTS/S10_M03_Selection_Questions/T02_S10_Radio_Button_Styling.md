# Task: Radio Button Custom Styling System

## Description
Create a comprehensive custom styling system for radio button components that provides consistent visual design, theming support, and customization options. This system will ensure radio buttons have a native look and feel across platforms.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish comprehensive styling for radio button components.
- Create custom radio button visual design
- Implement theming support for radio buttons
- Support different radio button states (default, selected, disabled, focused)
- Ensure consistent styling across iOS and Android
- Enable customization through style props

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Custom radio button design implemented with proper visual states
- [ ] Theming system supports radio button customization
- [ ] Visual states properly handled (default, selected, disabled, focused)
- [ ] Consistent appearance across iOS and Android platforms
- [ ] Style customization through props and theme overrides
- [ ] Accessibility-friendly color contrasts and visual indicators
- [ ] Performance optimized styling (no unnecessary re-renders)
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with RadioGroupQuestion from T01
- Must integrate with M01 theming system
- Must work with React Native styling patterns
- Must support accessibility requirements

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Native StyleSheet for performance
- Follow design system patterns from M01
- Use platform-specific styling when needed
- Follow accessibility color contrast guidelines

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle invalid style configurations gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for missing theme values
- Handle platform-specific styling errors
- Recover from style calculation errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Design radio button visual states and specifications
2. Create base radio button styles with proper dimensions
3. Implement state-based styling (selected, disabled, focused)
4. Add theming integration and customization support
5. Create platform-specific adjustments
6. Add accessibility-friendly visual indicators
7. Implement performance optimizations
8. Create comprehensive tests for all styling scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Styles must be performant and not cause unnecessary re-renders
- Must support both light and dark themes
- Must be customizable without breaking core functionality
- Must maintain accessibility requirements

**Testing approach:**
- Test visual state transitions and styling
- Test theming integration and customization
- Test platform-specific styling behavior
- Test accessibility color contrast requirements
- Test performance with rapid state changes
- Test style override and customization functionality

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design radio button visual states and specifications
- [ ] Create base RadioButton styled component
- [ ] Implement state-based styling system
- [ ] Add theming integration and support
- [ ] Create platform-specific style adjustments
- [ ] Add accessibility-friendly visual indicators
- [ ] Implement style customization through props
- [ ] Create performance optimizations for styling
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage

## Dependencies
- T01 RadioGroupQuestion component must be completed
- M01 theming system must be available

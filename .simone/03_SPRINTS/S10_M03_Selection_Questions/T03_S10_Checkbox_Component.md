# Task: Checkbox Question Component

## Description
Implement the Checkbox question component with multi-selection functionality. This component will render checkbox choices from survey-core data, manage multiple selection state, and integrate with validation for minimum/maximum selection requirements.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a fully functional checkbox question component with multi-selection.
- Implement CheckboxQuestion using BaseQuestion foundation
- Render checkbox choices from survey-core choice list
- Manage multi-selection state and survey integration
- Support min/max selection validation
- Implement accessibility features for checkbox groups

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CheckboxQuestion extends BaseQuestion functionality
- [ ] Renders checkbox choices from survey-core data
- [ ] Multi-selection state properly managed and synchronized
- [ ] Min/max selection validation working correctly
- [ ] Choice selection updates survey-core question value array
- [ ] Accessibility properly implemented (role, aria-checked, etc.)
- [ ] Custom styling support for checkboxes
- [ ] Performance optimized for large choice lists with multiple selections

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must use BaseQuestion foundation from S09
- Must work with QuestionWrapper for layout
- Must integrate with validation system for min/max selections
- Must work with survey-core checkbox question type

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Native TouchableOpacity for checkbox interaction
- Follow accessibility guidelines for checkbox groups
- Use controlled component patterns for multi-selection state
- Follow survey-core choice list rendering patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle invalid choice configurations gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for missing choice data
- Handle selection state synchronization errors
- Recover from validation errors with min/max selections

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create CheckboxQuestion component extending BaseQuestion
2. Implement choice list rendering from survey-core data
3. Add checkbox selection state management for multiple selections
4. Integrate with survey-core value array synchronization
5. Add min/max selection validation
6. Implement accessibility features for checkbox groups
7. Add custom styling support
8. Create comprehensive tests covering all functionality

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Component must handle array values for multi-selection
- Must support dynamic choice lists from survey-core
- Must maintain performance with large choice lists and selections
- Must integrate seamlessly with validation system

**Testing approach:**
- Test component rendering with various choice configurations
- Test multi-selection behavior and state management
- Test survey-core value array synchronization
- Test min/max selection validation scenarios
- Test accessibility features and ARIA attributes
- Test performance with large choice lists and multiple selections

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create CheckboxQuestion component structure
- [ ] Implement choice list rendering from survey-core
- [ ] Add CheckboxOption component for individual choices
- [ ] Implement multi-selection state management
- [ ] Integrate with survey-core value array synchronization
- [ ] Add min/max selection validation support
- [ ] Implement accessibility features (roles, ARIA)
- [ ] Add custom styling and theming support
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- [ ] Test integration with survey-core checkbox questions

## Dependencies
- S09 BaseQuestion foundation must be completed
- S09 Question registration system for type mapping
- S09 QuestionWrapper for layout
- S09 Validation integration for min/max selection rules

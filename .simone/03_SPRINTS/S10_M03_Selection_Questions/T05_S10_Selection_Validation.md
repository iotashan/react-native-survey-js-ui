# Task: Selection Question Validation

## Description
Implement comprehensive validation for selection questions (radio and checkbox) including required field validation, minimum/maximum selection rules, and custom validation messages. This ensures proper validation feedback for all selection scenarios.

## Goal / Objectives
Create robust validation for all selection question types.
- Implement required field validation for radio and checkbox questions
- Add minimum selection validation for checkbox questions
- Add maximum selection validation for checkbox questions
- Create custom validation messages for selection scenarios
- Integrate real-time validation feedback for selections

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Required field validation working for radio questions (must select one)
- [ ] Required field validation working for checkbox questions (must select at least one)
- [ ] Minimum selection validation for checkbox questions
- [ ] Maximum selection validation for checkbox questions
- [ ] Custom validation messages for different selection scenarios
- [ ] Real-time validation feedback during selection changes
- [ ] Validation messages properly localized and customizable
- [ ] Performance optimized for rapid selection changes

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with RadioGroupQuestion and CheckboxQuestion
- Must integrate with S09 validation foundation
- Must work with survey-core validation rules
- Must support custom validation messages

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use validation patterns established in S09
- Follow survey-core validation rule patterns
- Use React hooks for validation state management
- Follow accessibility guidelines for error messaging

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle invalid validation rule configurations
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Handle edge cases with empty or invalid selections
- Recover from validation rule execution errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Analyze selection validation requirements from survey-core
2. Implement required field validation for radio questions
3. Add required field validation for checkbox questions
4. Implement minimum selection validation for checkboxes
5. Add maximum selection validation for checkboxes
6. Create custom validation messages for selection scenarios
7. Integrate real-time validation feedback
8. Create comprehensive tests for all validation scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Validation must be consistent with survey-core rules
- Must provide immediate feedback for better user experience
- Must be performance optimized for rapid selection changes
- Must support custom validation messages and localization

**Testing approach:**
- Test required field validation for radio questions
- Test required field validation for checkbox questions
- Test minimum and maximum selection validation
- Test custom validation message display
- Test real-time validation feedback
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement required field validation for radio questions
- [ ] Add required field validation for checkbox questions
- [ ] Create minimum selection validation for checkboxes
- [ ] Implement maximum selection validation for checkboxes
- [ ] Add custom validation messages for selection scenarios
- [ ] Integrate real-time validation feedback system
- [ ] Create validation message localization support
- [ ] Add performance optimizations for validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage

## Dependencies
- T01 RadioGroupQuestion component must be completed
- T03 CheckboxQuestion component must be completed
- S09 Validation integration foundation
- S09 QuestionWrapper for error message display

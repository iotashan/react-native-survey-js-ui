# Task: Radio Button Question Component

## Description
Implement the RadioGroup question component with single selection functionality. This component will render radio button choices from survey-core data and manage single selection state with proper validation integration.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a fully functional radio button question component.
- Implement RadioGroupQuestion using BaseQuestion foundation
- Render radio button choices from survey-core choice list
- Manage single selection state and survey integration
- Support required field validation for radio groups
- Implement accessibility features for radio button groups

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] RadioGroupQuestion extends BaseQuestion functionality
- [ ] Renders radio button choices from survey-core data
- [ ] Single selection state properly managed and synchronized
- [ ] Required field validation working correctly
- [ ] Choice selection updates survey-core question value
- [ ] Accessibility properly implemented (role, aria-checked, etc.)
- [ ] Custom styling support for radio buttons
- [ ] Performance optimized for large choice lists

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL TASKS)
**MANDATORY**: After completing any task, perform simulator verification:
- [ ] Kill the app in the simulator
- [ ] Kill metro process (use `kill` command, not control-c)
- [ ] Run `pnpm start` (or `pnpm run:ios` if native code changed)
- [ ] Open the app in the simulator
- [ ] Confirm no catastrophic changes occurred
- [ ] If task was UI-facing, manually test the implemented functionality
- [ ] Verify app loads and functions correctly

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must use BaseQuestion foundation from S09
- Must work with QuestionWrapper for layout
- Must integrate with validation system from S09
- Must work with survey-core radiogroup question type

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Native TouchableOpacity for radio button interaction
- Follow accessibility guidelines for radio button groups
- Use controlled component patterns for selection state
- Follow survey-core choice list rendering patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle invalid choice configurations gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for missing choice data
- Handle selection state synchronization errors
- Recover from rendering errors with large choice lists

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create RadioGroupQuestion component extending BaseQuestion
2. Implement choice list rendering from survey-core data
3. Add radio button selection state management
4. Integrate with survey-core value synchronization
5. Add required field validation
6. Implement accessibility features for radio groups
7. Add custom styling support
8. Create comprehensive tests covering all functionality

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Component must be fully controlled for survey state management
- Must support dynamic choice lists from survey-core
- Must maintain performance with large choice lists
- Must integrate seamlessly with validation system

**Testing approach:**
- Test component rendering with various choice configurations
- Test single selection behavior and state management
- Test survey-core value synchronization
- Test required field validation
- Test accessibility features and ARIA attributes
- Test performance with large choice lists

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create RadioGroupQuestion component structure
- [ ] Implement choice list rendering from survey-core
- [ ] Add RadioOption component for individual choices
- [ ] Implement single selection state management
- [ ] Integrate with survey-core value synchronization
- [ ] Add required field validation support
- [ ] Implement accessibility features (roles, ARIA)
- [ ] Add custom styling and theming support
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- [ ] Test integration with survey-core radiogroup questions

## Dependencies
- S09 BaseQuestion foundation must be completed
- S09 Question registration system for type mapping
- S09 QuestionWrapper for layout
- S09 Validation integration

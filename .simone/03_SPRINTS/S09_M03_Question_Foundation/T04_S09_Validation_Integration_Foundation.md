# Task: Validation Integration Foundation

## Description
Integrate the M02 validation framework with the question component architecture to provide seamless validation support for all question types. This establishes the foundation for real-time and on-submit validation modes.

## Goal / Objectives
Create seamless integration between validation system and question components.
- Integrate M02 validation framework with BaseQuestion
- Establish validation state management for questions
- Create validation event handling and propagation
- Support both real-time and on-submit validation modes
- Implement validation error display coordination

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BaseQuestion integrates with M02 validation framework
- [ ] Validation state properly managed and synchronized
- [ ] Real-time validation triggers implemented
- [ ] On-submit validation mode supported
- [ ] Validation errors properly displayed and positioned
- [ ] Validation state changes trigger appropriate UI updates
- [ ] Custom validation rules supported through integration
- [ ] Performance optimized for rapid validation cycles

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with M02 ValidationProvider and validation context
- Must integrate with survey-core validation system
- Must work with BaseQuestion and QuestionWrapper components
- Must support all survey-core validation rules

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Context for validation state management
- Follow validation patterns established in M02
- Use React hooks for validation lifecycle management
- Follow error handling patterns from M02

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle validation rule execution errors gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Handle async validation scenarios
- Recover from validation system failures

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Analyze M02 validation framework integration points
2. Create validation hooks for question components
3. Implement validation state management in BaseQuestion
4. Add validation event handling and propagation
5. Integrate with QuestionWrapper for error display
6. Add support for real-time validation triggers
7. Implement on-submit validation coordination
8. Create comprehensive tests for all validation scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Validation must be non-blocking and performant
- Must support both synchronous and asynchronous validation
- Must maintain consistency with survey-core validation
- Must be extensible for custom validation rules

**Testing approach:**
- Test validation integration with various question types
- Test real-time validation triggers and updates
- Test on-submit validation coordination
- Test error display and state management
- Test performance with rapid validation cycles
- Test custom validation rule integration

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze M02 validation framework integration requirements
- [ ] Create validation hooks for question components
- [ ] Implement validation state management in BaseQuestion
- [ ] Add validation event handling and propagation
- [ ] Integrate validation error display with QuestionWrapper
- [ ] Implement real-time validation trigger system
- [ ] Add on-submit validation mode support
- [ ] Create validation performance optimization
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage

## Dependencies
- M02 validation framework must be completed
- T01 BaseQuestion component must be completed
- T03 QuestionWrapper system for error display

# Task: Create BaseQuestion Component

## Description
Create the foundational BaseQuestion component that provides common functionality for all question types. This component will serve as the base class/pattern for TextInput, RadioGroup, Checkbox, and all future question components.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a robust base architecture for question components.
- Create BaseQuestion component with common props and state management
- Implement question value handling and survey-core integration
- Establish common accessibility patterns
- Create reusable question lifecycle management
- Set up base styling and theming infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BaseQuestion component handles common question props (id, name, title, description, isRequired, isReadOnly)
- [ ] Question value state management integrated with survey-core
- [ ] Common accessibility props and patterns implemented
- [ ] Base styling system supports theming and customization
- [ ] Question lifecycle events properly handled (onValueChanged, onValidationStateChanged)
- [ ] Component supports both controlled and uncontrolled usage patterns
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces properly defined for extensibility

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must integrate with survey-core Question class
- Must work with M02 validation framework
- Must support accessibility requirements
- Must be extensible for all question types

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Follow React Native component patterns established in M01
- Use TypeScript for type safety and extensibility
- Follow accessibility guidelines for form controls
- Integrate with theming system from M01

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle invalid question configurations gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for missing required props
- Handle survey-core integration errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Define TypeScript interfaces for BaseQuestion props and state
2. Create BaseQuestion component with basic structure
3. Implement survey-core integration for value management
4. Add accessibility support and ARIA labels
5. Implement base styling and theming support
6. Add lifecycle event handling
7. Create comprehensive tests covering all functionality

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Component must be abstract/base - not directly renderable
- Must support all survey-core question properties
- Must be performance optimized for list rendering
- Must support React Native styling patterns

**Testing approach:**
- Test component initialization with various props
- Test value change handling and survey-core integration
- Test accessibility features and ARIA labels
- Test error handling for invalid configurations
- Test theming and styling customization

## Subtasks
- [ ] Define BaseQuestion TypeScript interfaces and props
- [ ] Create BaseQuestion component structure
- [ ] Implement survey-core question integration
- [ ] Add value state management and change handling
- [ ] Implement accessibility support (ARIA labels, hints)
- [ ] Create base styling and theming system
- [ ] Add lifecycle event handling (onValueChanged, validation)
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- [ ] Test integration with survey-core Question objects

## Dependencies
- M02 validation framework must be available
- Survey-core integration from M01 must be working
- Theming system from M01 must be established

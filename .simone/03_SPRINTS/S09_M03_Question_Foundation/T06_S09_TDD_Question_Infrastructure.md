# Task: TDD Question Infrastructure

## Description
Establish comprehensive TDD patterns and testing infrastructure specifically for question components. Create reusable testing utilities, patterns, and templates that will be used for all question component development in M03.

## Goal / Objectives
Create robust testing infrastructure for question component development.
- Establish TDD patterns for question component testing
- Create reusable testing utilities for question components
- Implement test templates for different question types
- Create performance testing patterns for question rendering
- Establish accessibility testing patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reusable testing utilities for question component testing
- [ ] Test templates for different question types (text, selection, etc.)
- [ ] Performance testing patterns for question rendering
- [ ] Accessibility testing utilities and patterns
- [ ] Mock utilities for survey-core question objects
- [ ] Testing patterns for validation integration
- [ ] Documentation for TDD question development process
- [ ] All testing utilities have >95% code coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL TASKS)
**MANDATORY**: After completing any task, perform simulator verification:
- [ ] Kill the app in the simulator
- [ ] Kill metro process (use `kill` command, not control-c)
- [ ] Run `pnpm start` (or `pnpm run:ios` if native code changed)
- [ ] Open the app in the simulator
- [ ] Confirm no catastrophic changes occurred
- [ ] If task was UI-facing, manually test the implemented functionality
- [ ] Verify app loads and functions correctly

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with existing testing infrastructure from M01
- Must support testing of BaseQuestion and derived components
- Must integrate with survey-core mock objects
- Must support validation testing patterns

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Build on Jest and React Native Testing Library patterns
- Use existing test utilities from M01 TDD infrastructure
- Follow established mocking patterns for survey-core
- Use performance testing patterns from M01

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle test setup and teardown errors gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for test failures
- Handle mock object creation errors
- Recover from test environment issues

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Analyze testing requirements for question components
2. Create reusable testing utilities for question components
3. Implement test templates for different question types
4. Add performance testing patterns for rendering
5. Create accessibility testing utilities
6. Implement mock utilities for survey-core integration
7. Create validation testing patterns
8. Document TDD process for question development

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Testing utilities must be reusable across all question types
- Must maintain high performance for rapid test execution
- Must support both unit and integration testing scenarios
- Must be easy to use and understand for development

**Testing approach:**
- Test the testing utilities themselves (meta-testing)
- Test performance testing patterns
- Test mock object creation and behavior
- Test accessibility testing utilities
- Test integration with existing test infrastructure

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze testing requirements for question components
- [ ] Create reusable testing utilities for question components
- [ ] Implement test templates for text input questions
- [ ] Add performance testing patterns for question rendering
- [ ] Create accessibility testing utilities and patterns
- [ ] Implement mock utilities for survey-core question objects
- [ ] Create validation testing patterns and utilities
- [ ] Document TDD process for question development
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for testing utilities

## Dependencies
- M01 TDD infrastructure must be available
- T01-T05 question components for testing pattern validation

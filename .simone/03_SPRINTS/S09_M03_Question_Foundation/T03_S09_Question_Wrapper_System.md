# Task: Question Wrapper System

## Description
Create a comprehensive question wrapper system that provides consistent layout, labeling, description display, and error message presentation for all question types. This wrapper will be used by all question components to ensure consistent UI patterns.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish consistent question presentation and layout patterns.
- Create QuestionWrapper component with label, description, and error display
- Implement QuestionLabel component with required field indicators
- Create QuestionDescription component with markdown support
- Establish consistent spacing and layout patterns
- Support accessibility requirements for form labels

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] QuestionWrapper provides consistent layout for all question types
- [ ] QuestionLabel displays title with required field indicators (*)
- [ ] QuestionDescription supports basic markdown and HTML
- [ ] Error message display integrated with validation system
- [ ] Consistent spacing and layout patterns across all questions
- [ ] Accessibility labels and associations properly implemented
- [ ] Support for custom styling and theming
- [ ] Responsive layout for different screen sizes

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with BaseQuestion component from T01
- Must integrate with M02 validation error display
- Must support survey-core question properties
- Must work with theming system from M01

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Follow React Native layout and styling patterns
- Use accessibility best practices for form controls
- Support markdown rendering for rich text
- Follow design system spacing and typography

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle missing or invalid question data gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for rendering errors
- Handle markdown parsing errors safely

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create QuestionWrapper component with basic layout
2. Implement QuestionLabel with title and required indicators
3. Create QuestionDescription with markdown support
4. Add error message display integration
5. Implement accessibility associations (aria-labelledby, etc.)
6. Add theming and styling support
7. Create responsive layout handling
8. Create comprehensive tests for all components

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Components must be composable and reusable
- Must support flexible layout configurations
- Must be performant for list rendering scenarios
- Must integrate with React Native styling system

**Testing approach:**
- Test component rendering with various props
- Test accessibility features and ARIA associations
- Test markdown rendering in descriptions
- Test error message display integration
- Test theming and styling customization
- Test responsive layout behavior

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create QuestionWrapper component with layout structure
- [ ] Implement QuestionLabel with title and required indicators
- [ ] Create QuestionDescription with markdown support
- [ ] Add error message display and styling
- [ ] Implement accessibility associations and labels
- [ ] Add theming support and style customization
- [ ] Create responsive layout patterns
- [ ] Add integration with validation error display
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage

## Dependencies
- T01 BaseQuestion component foundation
- M02 validation error display system
- M01 theming and styling system

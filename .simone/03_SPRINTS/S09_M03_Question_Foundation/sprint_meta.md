# Sprint: Question Foundation & Base Architecture (S09)

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational question architecture and base components that will support all question types in M03

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- BaseQuestion component with common functionality
- Question wrapper system with labels, descriptions, and error display
- Question type registration and factory system
- Foundation validation integration architecture
- Text input question component implementation
- TDD infrastructure for question components

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- BaseQuestion component fully tested and functional
- Question registration system working
- Text input questions working in sample app
- All components have >90% test coverage
- TDD patterns established for question development
- Foundation ready for radio and checkbox implementation

## Tasks
- [T01_S09_BaseQuestion_Component.md](./T01_S09_BaseQuestion_Component.md) - Create BaseQuestion component with common question functionality
- [T02_S09_Question_Registration_System.md](./T02_S09_Question_Registration_System.md) - Implement question type registration and factory system
- [T03_S09_Question_Wrapper_System.md](./T03_S09_Question_Wrapper_System.md) - Create question wrapper with labels, descriptions, and error display
- [T04_S09_Validation_Integration_Foundation.md](./T04_S09_Validation_Integration_Foundation.md) - Integrate validation system with question components
- [T05_S09_TextInput_Question_Component.md](./T05_S09_TextInput_Question_Component.md) - Implement TextInput question component with full functionality
- [T06_S09_TDD_Question_Infrastructure.md](./T06_S09_TDD_Question_Infrastructure.md) - Establish TDD patterns and testing infrastructure for question components

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint establishes the architectural foundation for all question types
- Focus on creating reusable patterns that will be extended in subsequent sprints
- Ensure validation integration is seamless from the start
- Dependencies: M02 validation framework must be completed

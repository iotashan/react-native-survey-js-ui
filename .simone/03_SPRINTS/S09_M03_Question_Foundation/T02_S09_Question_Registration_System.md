# Task: Question Type Registration and Factory System

## Description
Implement a question type registration and factory system that enables dynamic loading and rendering of different question components based on survey-core question types. This system will map survey-core question types to React Native components.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a flexible system for question type mapping and component instantiation.
- Implement QuestionFactory for type-to-component mapping
- Create question type registration system
- Support dynamic question component loading
- Handle unknown question types gracefully
- Enable easy extension for future question types

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] QuestionFactory maps survey-core question types to React Native components
- [ ] Registration system allows adding new question types
- [ ] Factory handles unknown question types with fallback component
- [ ] Type-specific prop validation and transformation
- [ ] Support for question type aliases and variations
- [ ] Factory supports lazy loading of question components
- [ ] Clear error messages for unsupported question types

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL TASKS)
**MANDATORY**: After completing any task, perform simulator verification:
- [ ] Kill the app in the simulator
- [ ] Kill metro process (use `kill` command, not control-c)
- [ ] Run `pnpm start` (or `pnpm run:ios` if native code changed)
- [ ] Open the app in the simulator
- [ ] Confirm no catastrophic changes occurred
- [ ] If task was UI-facing, manually test the implemented functionality
- [ ] Verify app loads and functions correctly

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with survey-core Question.getType() method
- Must integrate with BaseQuestion component from T01
- Must support registration of text, radiogroup, checkbox types
- Must be extensible for future question types

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use TypeScript for type safety and extensibility
- Follow React component factory patterns
- Use error boundaries for graceful degradation
- Follow React Native performance best practices

**Error handling approach:**
- Gracefully handle unregistered question types
- Provide fallback component for unknown types
- Log warnings for missing question type registrations
- Handle question component loading errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Define TypeScript interfaces for question registration
2. Create QuestionFactory class with registration methods
3. Implement question type mapping and component resolution
4. Add fallback component for unknown types
5. Create question component loader with error handling
6. Add type validation and prop transformation
7. Create comprehensive tests for all scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Factory must be singleton to maintain global registrations
- Must support both synchronous and asynchronous component loading
- Must be performant for rapid question rendering
- Must integrate seamlessly with React component lifecycle

**Testing approach:**
- Test registration of different question types
- Test component resolution for known and unknown types
- Test fallback behavior for unregistered types
- Test prop validation and transformation
- Test error handling and recovery

## Subtasks
- [ ] Define QuestionFactory TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Create QuestionFactory class with registration methods
- [ ] Implement question type to component mapping
- [ ] Add fallback component for unknown question types
- [ ] Create question component loader with error handling
- [ ] Implement type-specific prop validation
- [ ] Add support for question type aliases
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- [ ] Test integration with survey-core question types

## Dependencies
- T01 BaseQuestion component must be completed
- Survey-core integration from M01 must be working

# Task: TextInput Question Component

## Description
Implement the TextInput question component as the first concrete question type, serving as the reference implementation for all future question components. This component will demonstrate the full integration of BaseQuestion, validation, and survey-core.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a fully functional text input question component.
- Implement TextInputQuestion using BaseQuestion foundation
- Support all survey-core text input properties (placeholder, maxLength, inputType)
- Integrate keyboard type selection (email, numeric, phone, etc.)
- Implement input validation and real-time feedback
- Support accessibility features for text input

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TextInputQuestion extends BaseQuestion functionality
- [ ] Supports placeholder, maxLength, inputType, readOnly properties
- [ ] Keyboard type automatically selected based on inputType
- [ ] Input validation working (required, minLength, maxLength, patterns)
- [ ] Real-time validation feedback implemented
- [ ] Accessibility labels and hints properly configured
- [ ] Custom styling and theming support
- [ ] Performance optimized for smooth typing experience

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL TASKS)
**MANDATORY**: After completing any task, perform simulator verification:
- [ ] Kill the app in the simulator
- [ ] Kill metro process (use `kill` command, not control-c)
- [ ] Run `pnpm start` (or `pnpm run:ios` if native code changed)
- [ ] Open the app in the simulator
- [ ] Confirm no catastrophic changes occurred
- [ ] If task was UI-facing, manually test the implemented functionality
- [ ] Verify app loads and functions correctly

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must use BaseQuestion as foundation from T01
- Must work with QuestionWrapper from T03
- Must integrate with validation system from T04
- Must work with survey-core text question properties

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Native TextInput component patterns
- Follow accessibility guidelines for text input
- Use controlled component patterns for value management
- Follow React Native keyboard handling best practices

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle invalid input types gracefully
- Provide clear feedback for validation errors
- Handle keyboard type selection errors
- Recover from input focus/blur errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create TextInputQuestion component extending BaseQuestion
2. Implement survey-core text question property mapping
3. Add TextInput with proper keyboard type selection
4. Integrate validation with real-time feedback
5. Add accessibility support and ARIA labels
6. Implement custom styling and theming
7. Add performance optimizations for smooth typing
8. Create comprehensive tests covering all functionality

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Component must be fully controlled for survey state management
- Must support all React Native TextInput props when appropriate
- Must maintain performance during rapid typing
- Must integrate seamlessly with survey navigation

**Testing approach:**
- Test component rendering with various question properties
- Test keyboard type selection for different input types
- Test validation integration and error display
- Test accessibility features and ARIA labels
- Test performance with rapid input changes
- Test integration with survey-core data flow

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create TextInputQuestion component structure
- [ ] Implement survey-core text question property mapping
- [ ] Add React Native TextInput integration
- [ ] Implement keyboard type selection logic
- [ ] Integrate validation with real-time feedback
- [ ] Add accessibility support (labels, hints, roles)
- [ ] Implement custom styling and theming
- [ ] Add performance optimizations for typing
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- [ ] Test integration with survey-core question objects

## Dependencies
- T01 BaseQuestion component must be completed
- T02 Question registration system for type mapping
- T03 QuestionWrapper for layout and error display
- T04 Validation integration foundation

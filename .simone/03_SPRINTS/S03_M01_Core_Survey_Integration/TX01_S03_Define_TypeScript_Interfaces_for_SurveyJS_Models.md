# Task: Define TypeScript Interfaces for SurveyJS Models

## Description
Extend and refine the existing TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/SurveyTypes.ts` to comprehensively cover the core SurveyJS model types. This includes enhancing the existing basic interfaces and adding new interfaces for survey-core integration, ensuring full compatibility with SurveyJS JSON models.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces that mirror survey-core's model structure
- Ensure type safety for all SurveyJS JSON model properties
- Provide excellent developer experience with proper type definitions
- Maintain compatibility with survey-core version 1.9.x

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All core SurveyJS model types are properly defined
- [x] Interfaces include proper JSDoc documentation
- [x] Type definitions match survey-core's API surface
- [x] No TypeScript errors when using the interfaces
- [x] Export structure allows easy importing by consumers

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [x] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [x] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [x] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [x] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [x] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks
- [x] Write tests for TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/types.test.ts`
- [x] Enhance SurveyModel interface with all survey-core properties
- [x] Add interfaces for survey events and callbacks
- [x] Define interfaces for survey data and results
- [x] Add interfaces for theme and styling properties
- [x] Create type guards and utility types
- [x] Update exports in `src/types/index.ts`
- [x] Verify compatibility with survey-core types

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points in the codebase
- Existing interfaces: `SurveyModel`, `PageModel`, `QuestionModel`, `ValidatorModel`
- Current location: `src/types/SurveyTypes.ts`
- Export point: `src/types/index.ts`
- Used by: `src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx`, `src/components/Questions/BaseQuestion/BaseQuestion.tsx`

### Specific imports and module references
```typescript
// Reference survey-core types (installed as dependency)
import { ISurvey, IPage, IQuestion } from 'survey-core';
```

### Existing patterns to follow
- Use interface over type for object shapes
- Include JSDoc comments for all public interfaces
- Use index signatures for extensibility: `[key: string]: any`
- Export all types from index.ts for clean imports

### Error handling approach used in similar code
- Type guards for runtime type checking
- Optional properties marked with `?`
- Union types for known variants

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-step implementation approach
1. First write comprehensive tests that verify type compatibility
2. Examine survey-core's TypeScript definitions for reference
3. Enhance existing interfaces with missing properties
4. Add new interfaces for events, themes, and data structures
5. Create utility types for common patterns
6. Ensure all interfaces are properly exported

### Key architectural decisions to respect
- Maintain compatibility with SurveyJS JSON format
- Keep interfaces extensible for future question types
- Follow React Native TypeScript conventions
- Support both required and optional properties appropriately

### Testing approach based on existing test patterns
- Use type assertion tests to verify interface shapes
- Test that interfaces accept valid SurveyJS JSON
- Verify type inference works correctly
- Test utility types and type guards

### Performance considerations if relevant
- TypeScript interfaces have no runtime impact
- Focus on developer experience and type safety
- Keep type definitions readable and maintainable

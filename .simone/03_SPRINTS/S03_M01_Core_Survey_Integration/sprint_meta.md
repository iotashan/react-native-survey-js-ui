# Sprint: Core Survey Integration (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Build main Survey component with survey-core integration that renders SurveyJS models

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Create main Survey component in src/components/Survey/
- Integrate survey-core dependency for SurveyJS logic
- Implement base question architecture foundation
- Define TypeScript interfaces for SurveyJS models
- Create basic survey demo in example app tabs
- Establish event system foundation for survey interactions

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Survey component accepts and renders SurveyJS JSON models
- Basic survey functionality works in example app
- Survey-core integration properly implemented and functional
- TypeScript interfaces cover core SurveyJS types
- Both tabs demonstrate library capabilities (demo + exploration)
- Component exports correctly from library main index

## Tasks

### T01_S03 - Define TypeScript Interfaces for SurveyJS Models (Low)
Extend and refine TypeScript interfaces to comprehensively cover core SurveyJS model types, ensuring full compatibility with survey-core.

### T02_S03 - Integrate Survey-Core Dependency (Medium)
Create integration layer between survey-core library and React Native components, handling platform-specific differences and state management.

### T03_S03 - Create Main Survey Component (Medium)
Transform placeholder Survey component into fully functional implementation with survey-core integration, navigation, and completion handling.

### T04_S03 - Implement Base Question Architecture (Medium)
Establish foundational architecture for question types with BaseQuestion component, question factory pattern, and common functionality.

### T05_S03 - Establish Event System Foundation (Low)
Create event system bridging survey-core events with React components, handling lifecycle events and establishing event patterns.

### T06_S03 - Create Basic Survey Demo in Example App (Low)
Update Survey Demo tab with meaningful examples showcasing library functionality, event handling, and proper usage patterns.

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint delivers the core library functionality
- Focus on proper survey-core integration patterns
- Ensure TypeScript types provide excellent developer experience
- Keep component architecture extensible for future question types

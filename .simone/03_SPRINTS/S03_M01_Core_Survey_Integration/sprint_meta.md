# Sprint: Core Survey Integration (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Build main Survey component with survey-core integration that renders SurveyJS models

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Create main Survey component in src/components/Survey/
- Integrate survey-core dependency for SurveyJS logic
- Implement base question architecture foundation
- Define TypeScript interfaces for SurveyJS models
- Create basic survey demo in example app tabs
- Establish event system foundation for survey interactions

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Survey component accepts and renders SurveyJS JSON models
- Basic survey functionality works in example app
- Survey-core integration properly implemented and functional
- TypeScript interfaces cover core SurveyJS types
- Both tabs demonstrate library capabilities (demo + exploration)
- Component exports correctly from library main index

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint delivers the core library functionality
- Focus on proper survey-core integration patterns
- Ensure TypeScript types provide excellent developer experience
- Keep component architecture extensible for future question types

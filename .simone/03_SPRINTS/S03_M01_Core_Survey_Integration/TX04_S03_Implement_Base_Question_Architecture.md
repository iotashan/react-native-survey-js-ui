# Task: Implement Base Question Architecture

## Description
Establish the foundational architecture for rendering different question types in the survey. This includes enhancing the BaseQuestion component to serve as a parent class for all question types, implementing a question factory pattern, and creating the infrastructure for future question type implementations.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a robust base question architecture that all question types will inherit from
- Implement a question factory/registry pattern for dynamic question rendering
- Establish common question functionality (validation, required fields, visibility)
- Set up the pattern for future question type implementations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] BaseQuestion component handles common question properties
- [x] Question factory can dynamically render different question types
- [x] Basic text question type implemented as proof of concept
- [x] Questions properly integrate with survey-core models
- [x] Validation and required field indicators work
- [x] Question visibility conditions are respected

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [x] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [x] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [x] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [x] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [x] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks
- [x] Write tests for BaseQuestion enhancements
- [x] Enhance BaseQuestion with common functionality
- [x] Create QuestionFactory component/utility
- [x] Implement question type registry pattern
- [x] Create TextQuestion as first concrete implementation
- [x] Add validation display and handling
- [x] Implement required field indicators
- [x] Handle question visibility logic

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points in the codebase
- Base component: `src/components/Questions/BaseQuestion/BaseQuestion.tsx`
- Question types: `src/components/Questions/` (create new question types here)
- Type definitions: `src/types/SurveyTypes.ts` (QuestionModel interface)
- Survey component: `src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx` (will use question factory)

### Specific imports and module references
```typescript
import { Question } from 'survey-core';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import type { QuestionModel } from '../../../types';
```

### Existing patterns to follow
- Component structure in `src/components/Questions/`
- Export pattern through index.ts files
- Test files alongside components
- StyleSheet usage for styling

### Error handling approach used in similar code
- Fallback to BaseQuestion for unknown types
- Console warnings for missing question types
- Graceful handling of invalid question data
- Clear error messages for developers

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-step implementation approach
1. Write tests for enhanced BaseQuestion functionality
2. Add common props (required, validators, visibility)
3. Create QuestionFactory with type registry
4. Implement TextQuestion as concrete example
5. Add validation error display
6. Implement required field indicators (*)
7. Handle visibility conditions from survey-core
8. Update Survey component to use QuestionFactory

### Key architectural decisions to respect
- BaseQuestion is abstract parent for all questions
- Question types are registered, not hard-coded
- Each question type is a separate component
- Common functionality stays in BaseQuestion
- Survey-core handles all logic, components handle UI

### Testing approach based on existing test patterns
- Test BaseQuestion with different props
- Test QuestionFactory registration and rendering
- Test validation display and behavior
- Test required field functionality
- Test visibility conditions
- Integration tests with Survey component

### Performance considerations if relevant
- Lazy load question type components
- Memoize question rendering when possible
- Efficient re-renders on value changes
- Consider virtualization for many questions

# Task: Establish Event System Foundation

## Description
Create the foundational event system that bridges survey-core events with React Native components. This includes handling survey lifecycle events (onValueChanged, onComplete, onCurrentPageChanged) and establishing patterns for future event handling throughout the library.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement event forwarding from survey-core to React components
- Create consistent event handling patterns for the library
- Handle key survey events: value changes, completion, navigation
- Establish TypeScript types for all event handlers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Survey component properly forwards survey-core events
- [ ] onValueChanged fires when question values change
- [ ] onComplete fires with survey data when completed
- [ ] onCurrentPageChanged fires during navigation
- [ ] All events have proper TypeScript definitions
- [ ] Event handlers don't cause memory leaks

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks
- [ ] Write tests for event handling scenarios
- [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces for event handlers
- [ ] Implement event forwarding in Survey component
- [ ] Add proper event cleanup on unmount
- [ ] Create event utility functions if needed
- [ ] Test event handling in example app
- [ ] Document event usage patterns

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points in the codebase
- Survey component: `src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx`
- Type definitions: `src/types/SurveyTypes.ts` (add event types)
- Survey-core utils: `src/utils/surveyCore.ts`
- Example app: `example/src/screens/SurveyDemoScreen.tsx`

### Specific imports and module references
```typescript
import { Model, SurveyModel as CoreSurveyModel } from 'survey-core';
// survey-core events: onValueChanged, onComplete, onCurrentPageChanged, etc.
```

### Existing patterns to follow
- Props interface pattern in Survey component
- Optional callback props with `?`
- Type-safe event handler signatures
- UseEffect for lifecycle management

### Error handling approach used in similar code
- Try-catch around event handlers
- Console errors for handler exceptions
- Continue survey operation if handler fails
- Null checks for optional handlers

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-step implementation approach
1. Write tests for each event type
2. Add event handler props to SurveyProps interface
3. Set up event listeners in useEffect
4. Forward survey-core events to prop callbacks
5. Ensure proper cleanup on unmount
6. Add TypeScript types for event payloads
7. Test in example app with console logs

### Key architectural decisions to respect
- Events are optional (all handlers use `?`)
- Survey-core is the source of all events
- React components are passive receivers
- No custom event system, use survey-core's

### Testing approach based on existing test patterns
- Mock event handlers with jest.fn()
- Trigger events through survey-core model
- Verify handlers called with correct data
- Test cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Test error handling in callbacks

### Performance considerations if relevant
- Remove listeners on component unmount
- Avoid creating new functions in render
- Use useCallback for handler stability
- Debounce rapid value changes if needed

[2025-06-05 10:24]: Started task T05_S03 Establish Event System Foundation
[2025-06-05 10:26]: ✅ Completed subtask: Write tests for event handling scenarios - Added comprehensive test cases for onValueChanged, onCurrentPageChanged events and cleanup
[2025-06-05 10:27]: ✅ Completed subtask: Define TypeScript interfaces for event handlers - Added SurveyValueChangedEvent, SurveyCurrentPageChangedEvent, SurveyCompleteEvent and handler types
[2025-06-05 10:29]: ✅ Completed subtask: Implement event forwarding in Survey component - Added onValueChanged and onCurrentPageChanged props with survey-core event integration
[2025-06-05 10:30]: ✅ Completed subtask: Add proper event cleanup on unmount - Already implemented with useEffect cleanup functions and tested
[2025-06-05 10:30]: ✅ Completed subtask: Create event utility functions if needed - Event handling is simple enough that utilities are not needed; error handling built into handlers
[2025-06-05 10:32]: ✅ Completed subtask: Test event handling in example app - Added comprehensive event handlers with live logging to SurveyDemoScreen and verified tests pass
[2025-06-05 10:34]: ✅ Completed subtask: Document event usage patterns - Created comprehensive EVENTS.md documentation and updated README with event examples
[2025-06-05 10:34]: Task completed successfully - All acceptance criteria met

[2025-06-05 10:33]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All specifications and requirements have been met exactly as documented.
**Scope:** T05_S03 Establish Event System Foundation - Event system implementation for Survey component with survey-core integration.
**Findings:** No issues found. All acceptance criteria met:
- Survey component properly forwards survey-core events (Severity: 0/10)
- onValueChanged and onCurrentPageChanged events implemented correctly (Severity: 0/10)

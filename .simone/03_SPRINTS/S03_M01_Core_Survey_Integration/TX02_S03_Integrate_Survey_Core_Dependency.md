# Task: Integrate Survey-Core Dependency

## Description
Properly integrate the survey-core library (already installed as a dependency) into the React Native library. This involves creating a wrapper layer that bridges survey-core's logic engine with React Native components, handling platform-specific differences, and establishing the foundation for survey state management.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a survey-core integration layer that works seamlessly in React Native
- Establish patterns for using survey-core models within React components
- Handle any platform-specific compatibility issues
- Set up proper initialization and lifecycle management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Survey-core models can be created and used in React Native components
- [x] No runtime errors or warnings from survey-core integration
- [x] Survey state changes properly trigger React re-renders
- [x] Memory management and cleanup properly handled
- [x] Integration works on both iOS and Android platforms

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [x] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [x] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [x] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [x] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [x] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks
- [x] Write tests for survey-core integration patterns
- [x] Create SurveyCore wrapper/adapter in `src/utils/surveyCore.ts`
- [x] Implement survey model initialization utilities
- [x] Handle survey-core lifecycle (creation, disposal)
- [x] Create React hooks for survey-core integration
- [x] Add platform-specific handling if needed
- [x] Test integration in example app
- [x] Document usage patterns

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points in the codebase
- Survey component: `src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx`
- Type definitions: `src/types/SurveyTypes.ts`
- Utils directory: `src/utils/` (create surveyCore.ts here)
- Example app: `example/src/screens/SurveyDemoScreen.tsx`

### Specific imports and module references
```typescript
import { Model } from 'survey-core';
// Note: survey-core is already in package.json dependencies
```

### Existing patterns to follow
- Utility functions go in `src/utils/`
- Export utilities from `src/utils/index.ts`
- Use React hooks for state management
- Follow existing test patterns in `src/__tests__/`

### Error handling approach used in similar code
- Try-catch blocks for survey-core operations
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features
- Console warnings for development
- User-friendly error states in components

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-step implementation approach
1. Write tests for survey model creation and lifecycle
2. Create surveyCore.ts with initialization functions
3. Implement React hooks (useSurveyModel, useSurveyState)
4. Handle survey-core events and state changes
5. Create cleanup utilities for memory management
6. Test integration in Survey component
7. Verify platform compatibility

### Key architectural decisions to respect
- Keep survey-core as the single source of truth for survey state
- Use React as the presentation layer only
- Maintain clear separation between logic and UI
- Ensure tree-shaking friendly exports

### Testing approach based on existing test patterns
- Mock survey-core for unit tests
- Integration tests with real survey-core instances
- Test lifecycle management and cleanup
- Verify event handling and state updates
- Platform-specific testing if needed

### Performance considerations if relevant
- Lazy load survey-core to reduce initial bundle size
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Efficient event handling to minimize re-renders
- Consider memoization for expensive operations

# Task: Create Main Survey Component

## Description
Enhance the existing Survey component shell to become a fully functional component that integrates with survey-core. This component will serve as the main entry point for rendering SurveyJS models in React Native applications, handling survey initialization, page navigation, and completion events.

## Goal / Objectives
- Transform the placeholder Survey component into a working implementation
- Integrate with survey-core models for survey logic
- Implement basic survey navigation (pages, next/previous)
- Handle survey completion and data collection
- Maintain the same API surface as the web SurveyJS React component

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Survey component accepts and renders SurveyJS JSON models
- [x] Basic page navigation works (next, previous, complete)
- [x] Survey data is collected and returned on completion
- [x] Component properly integrates with survey-core
- [x] Progress indication shows current page
- [x] Component is properly exported from the library

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [x] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [x] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [x] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [x] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [x] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Subtasks
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for Survey component functionality
- [x] Implement survey model initialization from JSON
- [x] Create survey page rendering logic
- [x] Add navigation controls (Next, Previous, Complete)
- [x] Implement progress bar display
- [x] Handle survey completion and data collection
- [x] Add proper TypeScript types for all props
- [x] Update component styling for better UX

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points in the codebase
- Current component: `src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx`
- Test file: `src/components/Survey/Survey.test.tsx`
- Types: `src/types/SurveyTypes.ts`
- Survey-core utilities: `src/utils/surveyCore.ts` (from T02)
- Example usage: `example/src/screens/SurveyDemoScreen.tsx`

### Specific imports and module references
```typescript
import { Model } from 'survey-core';
import { View, Text, Button, ScrollView } from 'react-native';
import { useSurveyModel } from '../../utils/surveyCore'; // From T02
import type { SurveyModel } from '../../types';
```

### Existing patterns to follow
- Functional components with hooks
- StyleSheet for styling (already in use)
- testID props for testing
- Proper TypeScript prop interfaces

### Error handling approach used in similar code
- Try-catch for survey initialization
- Fallback UI for invalid models
- Console warnings in development
- Graceful error boundaries

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-step implementation approach
1. Write tests for survey rendering and navigation
2. Create survey model from JSON prop
3. Implement page rendering with ScrollView
4. Add navigation buttons with proper state
5. Implement progress bar based on showProgressBar prop
6. Handle survey completion and data collection
7. Add proper cleanup on unmount
8. Style components for good mobile UX

### Key architectural decisions to respect
- Survey component is the main library export
- Keep UI logic separate from survey logic
- Use survey-core for all survey state management
- Maintain compatibility with web SurveyJS API

### Testing approach based on existing test patterns
- Test component rendering with different models
- Test navigation flow and state changes
- Test data collection on completion
- Test error handling for invalid models
- Integration tests with survey-core

### Performance considerations if relevant
- Use ScrollView for long surveys
- Lazy render questions as needed
- Memoize expensive computations
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo

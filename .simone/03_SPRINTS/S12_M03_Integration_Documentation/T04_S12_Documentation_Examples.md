# Task: Comprehensive Documentation and Examples

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation for all M03 components including usage examples, API reference, best practices, and troubleshooting guides. This documentation will help developers understand and effectively use the question types and validation system.

## Goal / Objectives
Provide complete documentation for M03 functionality and usage.
- Create API reference documentation for all question components
- Add usage examples and code samples for common scenarios
- Document validation system configuration and customization
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Add best practices documentation for question design

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API reference documentation complete for all question types
- [ ] Usage examples provided for TextInput, RadioGroup, and Checkbox questions
- [ ] Validation system documentation with configuration examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues and solutions
- [ ] Best practices documentation for question design and UX
- [ ] Code samples that can be copied and used directly
- [ ] Documentation is well-organized and easily navigable
- [ ] All documentation includes TypeScript type information

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL UI TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All UI-related development must be tested in iOS Simulator:
- [ ] Launch example app in iOS Simulator (use `pnpm run:ios` if native changes, `pnpm start` otherwise)
- [ ] Navigate to relevant screens/features
- [ ] Test all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Verify accessibility features (VoiceOver if applicable)
- [ ] Test with different device sizes/orientations if relevant
- [ ] Confirm no runtime errors or crashes
- [ ] Test hot reload works for iterative development
- [ ] Document any simulator-specific issues or limitations

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must document all components from S09, S10, and S11
- Must include integration examples with survey-core
- Must provide examples for validation scenarios
- Must include accessibility documentation

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Follow documentation patterns established in M01
- Use established code sample and example patterns
- Follow React Native documentation conventions
- Use TypeScript documentation patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle documentation generation errors gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for missing documentation
- Handle code sample validation errors
- Recover from documentation build errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create documentation structure and organization
2. Write API reference documentation for all question types
3. Create usage examples and code samples
4. Document validation system configuration and usage
5. Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
6. Add best practices documentation
7. Create interactive examples and demos
8. Validate all documentation and code samples

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Documentation must be accurate and up-to-date
- Must include practical, working examples
- Must be easily maintainable and updatable
- Must be accessible and well-organized

**Testing approach:**
- Test all code samples for accuracy and functionality
- Test documentation completeness and coverage
- Test documentation accessibility and usability
- Test integration with development workflow
- Test documentation build and deployment

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create documentation structure and navigation
- [ ] Write API reference for TextInput question component
- [ ] Document RadioGroup question component with examples
- [ ] Create Checkbox question component documentation
- [ ] Document validation system configuration and usage
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Add best practices documentation for question design
- [ ] Create interactive examples and code samples
- [ ] Validate all documentation and examples for accuracy

## Dependencies
- All components from S09, S10, and S11 for documentation
- Working sample app for interactive examples
- Documentation infrastructure from M01 (if available)

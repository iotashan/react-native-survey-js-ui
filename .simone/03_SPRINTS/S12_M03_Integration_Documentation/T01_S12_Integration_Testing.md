# Task: Comprehensive Integration Testing

## Description
Create comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete M03 system including all question types, validation scenarios, and cross-component interactions. This ensures all components work together seamlessly and meet the milestone requirements.

## Goal / Objectives
Validate complete M03 system integration and functionality.
- Create end-to-end integration tests for all question types
- Test complete validation workflows (real-time and on-submit)
- Validate survey-core integration across all components
- Test complex scenarios with multiple question types and validation
- Ensure performance requirements are met across the entire system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests for TextInput, RadioGroup, and Checkbox questions
- [ ] Complete validation workflow testing (real-time and on-submit)
- [ ] Survey-core integration tests for all question types
- [ ] Multi-question survey testing with complex validation scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing for large surveys with many questions
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (iOS and Android)
- [ ] Accessibility integration testing
- [ ] All integration tests achieve >95% reliability

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL UI TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All UI-related development must be tested in iOS Simulator:
- [ ] Launch example app in iOS Simulator (use `pnpm run:ios` if native changes, `pnpm start` otherwise)
- [ ] Navigate to relevant screens/features
- [ ] Test all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Verify accessibility features (VoiceOver if applicable)
- [ ] Test with different device sizes/orientations if relevant
- [ ] Confirm no runtime errors or crashes
- [ ] Test hot reload works for iterative development
- [ ] Document any simulator-specific issues or limitations

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must test all components from S09, S10, and S11
- Must validate integration with M02 page/panel system
- Must test survey-core integration comprehensively
- Must validate accessibility and performance requirements

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use existing integration testing patterns from M01
- Follow React Native Testing Library patterns for component integration
- Use established performance testing patterns
- Follow accessibility testing guidelines

**Error handling approach:**
- Test error scenarios and recovery across component boundaries
- Validate error propagation and handling in complex scenarios
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure graceful degradation in failure scenarios

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create end-to-end integration test suite structure
2. Implement question type integration tests
3. Add complete validation workflow testing
4. Create multi-question survey integration tests
5. Add performance testing for large surveys
6. Implement cross-platform testing scenarios
7. Add accessibility integration testing
8. Create comprehensive error scenario testing

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Integration tests must be reliable and not flaky
- Must test realistic user scenarios and workflows
- Must validate system performance under load
- Must ensure accessibility compliance across all components

**Testing approach:**
- Test complete user workflows from start to finish
- Test integration between all major components
- Test performance with realistic survey sizes
- Test accessibility across all question types
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- Test cross-platform compatibility

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create end-to-end integration test suite structure
- [ ] Implement TextInput question integration tests
- [ ] Add RadioGroup question integration tests
- [ ] Create Checkbox question integration tests
- [ ] Implement complete validation workflow testing
- [ ] Add multi-question survey integration tests
- [ ] Create performance testing for large surveys
- [ ] Implement cross-platform testing scenarios
- [ ] Add accessibility integration testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive error scenario testing

## Dependencies
- All components from S09, S10, and S11 must be completed
- M02 page/panel system for navigation testing
- Sample app for end-to-end testing scenarios

# Task: Sample App Enhancement and Showcase

## Description
Enhance the sample app to provide a comprehensive showcase of all M03 functionality including all question types, validation scenarios, and interactive demonstrations. This creates a testing ground and demonstration platform for the complete M03 system.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a comprehensive demonstration platform for M03 functionality.
- Enhance Survey tab with complete multi-question surveys using all question types
- Create comprehensive Explore tab with interactive question type demonstrations
- Add validation demonstration screens showing all validation scenarios
- Create performance demonstration with large surveys
- Add accessibility demonstration and testing screens

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Survey tab contains multi-question surveys using TextInput, RadioGroup, and Checkbox
- [ ] Explore tab provides interactive demonstrations of all question types
- [ ] Validation demonstration screens show real-time and on-submit validation
- [ ] Performance demonstration with large surveys (50+ questions)
- [ ] Accessibility demonstration screens for testing accessibility features
- [ ] Error state demonstrations for all validation scenarios
- [ ] Interactive examples allow users to test all features
- [ ] Sample app provides educational value for developers

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL UI TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All UI-related development must be tested in iOS Simulator:
- [ ] Launch example app in iOS Simulator (use `pnpm run:ios` if native changes, `pnpm start` otherwise)
- [ ] Navigate to relevant screens/features
- [ ] Test all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Verify accessibility features (VoiceOver if applicable)
- [ ] Test with different device sizes/orientations if relevant
- [ ] Confirm no runtime errors or crashes
- [ ] Test hot reload works for iterative development
- [ ] Document any simulator-specific issues or limitations

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must showcase all components from S09, S10, and S11
- Must demonstrate integration with M02 page/panel system
- Must work with existing sample app navigation
- Must provide realistic usage scenarios

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Follow existing sample app structure and navigation patterns
- Use established data patterns for survey examples
- Follow React Navigation patterns for screen organization
- Use existing styling and theming patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle sample data loading errors gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for demonstration failures
- Handle navigation errors between demonstration screens
- Recover from component demonstration errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Design comprehensive sample app enhancement plan
2. Create multi-question surveys for Survey tab
3. Enhance Explore tab with interactive question demonstrations
4. Add validation demonstration screens
5. Create performance demonstration with large surveys
6. Add accessibility demonstration screens
7. Create error state and edge case demonstrations
8. Add educational content and explanations

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Sample app must demonstrate real-world usage scenarios
- Must showcase both basic and advanced functionality
- Must provide educational and testing value
- Must be maintainable and easily updatable

**Testing approach:**
- Test sample app navigation and functionality
- Test all demonstration screens work correctly
- Test survey completion workflows
- Test validation demonstrations
- Test performance with large survey demonstrations
- Test accessibility demonstration features

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design comprehensive sample app enhancement plan
- [ ] Create multi-question surveys using all question types for Survey tab
- [ ] Enhance Explore tab with interactive question type demonstrations
- [ ] Add validation demonstration screens (real-time and on-submit)
- [ ] Create performance demonstration with large surveys
- [ ] Add accessibility demonstration and testing screens
- [ ] Create error state and edge case demonstrations
- [ ] Add educational content and explanations for all features
- [ ] Test all sample app enhancements comprehensively

## Dependencies
- All components from S09, S10, and S11 must be completed
- Existing sample app structure and navigation
- M02 page/panel system for multi-page surveys

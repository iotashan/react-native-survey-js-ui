# Task: Final Testing and Validation

## Description
Conduct comprehensive final testing and validation to ensure M03 meets all requirements and is ready for completion. This includes final integration testing, acceptance criteria validation, performance verification, and preparation for M04.

## Goal / Objectives
Validate M03 completion and prepare for milestone transition.
- Validate all M03 success criteria and deliverables
- Conduct final integration testing across all components
- Verify performance benchmarks and requirements
- Validate documentation completeness and accuracy
- Prepare M03 completion report and handoff to M04

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All M03 success criteria validated and met
- [ ] Final integration testing passes for all components
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed requirements
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Sample app demonstrates all M03 functionality
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% code coverage maintained
- [ ] M03 completion report prepared
- [ ] Foundation ready for M04 advanced question types

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Simulator Verification (FOR ALL UI TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All UI-related development must be tested in iOS Simulator:
- [ ] Launch example app in iOS Simulator (use `pnpm run:ios` if native changes, `pnpm start` otherwise)
- [ ] Navigate to relevant screens/features
- [ ] Test all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Verify accessibility features (VoiceOver if applicable)
- [ ] Test with different device sizes/orientations if relevant
- [ ] Confirm no runtime errors or crashes
- [ ] Test hot reload works for iterative development
- [ ] Document any simulator-specific issues or limitations

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must validate all components from S09, S10, and S11
- Must verify integration with M02 dependencies
- Must validate foundation readiness for M04
- Must ensure production readiness

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Follow established testing and validation patterns
- Use milestone completion criteria from M03 requirements
- Follow quality assurance patterns from M01
- Use performance validation patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle validation failures with clear reporting
- Provide detailed feedback for any failing criteria
- Handle edge cases in final testing scenarios
- Recover from validation errors with remediation plans

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create comprehensive validation checklist from M03 requirements
2. Conduct final integration testing across all components
3. Validate performance benchmarks and requirements
4. Verify documentation completeness and accuracy
5. Test sample app functionality comprehensively
6. Validate code coverage and test quality
7. Prepare M03 completion report
8. Create handoff documentation for M04

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Validation must be thorough and comprehensive
- Must ensure production readiness and quality
- Must verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Must prepare solid foundation for future milestones

**Testing approach:**
- Test all M03 deliverables against success criteria
- Test integration scenarios comprehensively
- Test performance under realistic conditions
- Test documentation accuracy and completeness
- Test sample app functionality and user experience
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create comprehensive validation checklist from M03 requirements
- [ ] Conduct final integration testing for all question types
- [ ] Validate performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Verify documentation completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Test sample app functionality and user experience
- [ ] Validate code coverage and test quality metrics
- [ ] Prepare comprehensive M03 completion report
- [ ] Create handoff documentation and foundation overview for M04
- [ ] Conduct final review and sign-off process

## Dependencies
- All tasks from S09, S10, and S11 must be completed
- M03 milestone requirements and success criteria
- Performance benchmarking tools and criteria

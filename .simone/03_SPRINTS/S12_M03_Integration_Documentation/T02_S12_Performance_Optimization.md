# Task: Performance Optimization and Benchmarking

## Description
Optimize performance for all M03 components and establish performance benchmarks to ensure smooth user experience. This includes optimizing question rendering, validation performance, and overall survey interaction responsiveness.

## Goal / Objectives
Optimize and benchmark M03 performance for production readiness.
- Optimize question component rendering performance
- Improve validation system performance for real-time feedback
- Benchmark survey loading and interaction performance
- Optimize memory usage for large surveys
- Establish performance monitoring and measurement tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Question component rendering optimized for smooth scrolling
- [ ] Validation performance optimized for real-time feedback
- [ ] Survey loading time meets performance benchmarks (<2s for 50 questions)
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for large surveys (>100 questions)
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools implemented
- [ ] Benchmark suite established for ongoing performance tracking
- [ ] Performance regression testing implemented
- [ ] Cross-platform performance parity achieved

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must optimize all question components from S09 and S10
- Must optimize validation systems from S11
- Must work with React Native performance optimization tools
- Must integrate with existing performance monitoring

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Native performance optimization patterns (FlatList, memo, etc.)
- Follow React hooks optimization patterns (useMemo, useCallback)
- Use React Native performance profiling tools
- Follow established benchmarking patterns from M01

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle performance optimization errors gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for performance optimization failures
- Handle memory pressure scenarios
- Recover from performance monitoring errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Profile current performance and identify bottlenecks
2. Optimize question component rendering with React.memo and hooks
3. Optimize validation performance with debouncing and caching
4. Implement memory usage optimizations for large surveys
5. Create performance monitoring and measurement tools
6. Establish benchmark suite for ongoing tracking
7. Implement performance regression testing
8. Validate cross-platform performance parity

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Performance optimizations must not compromise functionality
- Must maintain compatibility across iOS and Android
- Must be measurable and trackable over time
- Must support large-scale survey scenarios

**Testing approach:**
- Test performance improvements with before/after measurements
- Test memory usage with large survey scenarios
- Test rendering performance with rapid scrolling
- Test validation performance with complex rules
- Test cross-platform performance consistency
- Test performance regression scenarios

## Subtasks
- [ ] Profile current performance and identify optimization targets
- [ ] Optimize question component rendering with React optimization patterns
- [ ] Improve validation system performance with caching and debouncing
- [ ] Implement memory usage optimizations for large surveys
- [ ] Create performance monitoring and measurement tools
- [ ] Establish benchmark suite for ongoing performance tracking
- [ ] Implement performance regression testing
- [ ] Validate and document cross-platform performance parity
- [ ] Create performance optimization documentation

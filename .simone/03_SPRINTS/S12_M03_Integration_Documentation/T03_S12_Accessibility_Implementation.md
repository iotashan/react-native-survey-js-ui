# Task: Comprehensive Accessibility Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive accessibility features for all M03 components to ensure compliance with accessibility standards and provide excellent user experience for users with disabilities. This includes screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and visual accessibility features.

## Goal / Objectives
Ensure M03 components are fully accessible and compliant with accessibility standards.
- Implement screen reader support for all question types
- Add keyboard navigation support for question interactions
- Ensure proper accessibility labels and hints
- Implement focus management for complex validation scenarios
- Add support for accessibility preferences and settings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Screen reader support working for all question types (TextInput, RadioGroup, Checkbox)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation implemented for all interactive elements
- [ ] Proper accessibility labels and hints for all components
- [ ] Focus management working for validation errors and navigation
- [ ] Support for accessibility preferences (reduce motion, high contrast)
- [ ] Accessibility testing passing for all components
- [ ] Compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- [ ] Cross-platform accessibility parity (iOS VoiceOver, Android TalkBack)

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must implement accessibility for all question components from S09 and S10
- Must work with validation systems from S11 for error announcement
- Must integrate with React Native accessibility APIs
- Must support both iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Native accessibility props and patterns
- Follow WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines
- Use platform-specific accessibility APIs when needed
- Follow accessibility testing patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle accessibility API errors gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for accessibility feature failures
- Handle screen reader state changes
- Recover from focus management errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Audit current accessibility implementation across all components
2. Implement screen reader support for all question types
3. Add keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
4. Implement proper accessibility labels and hints
5. Add focus management for validation and navigation
6. Implement support for accessibility preferences
7. Create accessibility testing suite
8. Validate cross-platform accessibility compliance

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Accessibility must be built-in, not added as an afterthought
- Must work seamlessly across iOS and Android platforms
- Must not compromise performance or functionality
- Must be testable and verifiable

**Testing approach:**
- Test screen reader functionality with VoiceOver and TalkBack
- Test keyboard navigation across all components
- Test accessibility labels and hint announcements
- Test focus management during validation and navigation
- Test accessibility preferences support
- Test compliance with accessibility standards

## Subtasks
- [ ] Audit current accessibility implementation across M03 components
- [ ] Implement screen reader support for TextInput questions
- [ ] Add screen reader support for RadioGroup questions
- [ ] Implement screen reader support for Checkbox questions
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation for all question interactions
- [ ] Implement proper accessibility labels and hints
- [ ] Add focus management for validation errors and navigation
- [ ] Implement support for accessibility preferences
- [ ] Create comprehensive accessibility testing suite
- [ ] Validate cross-platform accessibility compliance

## Dependencies
- All question components from S09 and S10
- Validation systems from S11 for error announcement
- React Native accessibility APIs and tools

# Task: Explore Tab Panel Demo

## Description
Add comprehensive panel functionality demonstration to the Explore tab of the example app. This will showcase all panel capabilities including nested panels, different layouts, collapse/expand functionality, and interactive examples for developers to understand panel usage.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create interactive panel demonstrations in Explore tab
- Show various panel configurations and use cases
- Demonstrate nested panel capabilities
- Provide code examples for each panel variant
- Ensure smooth user experience on mobile devices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Explore tab includes dedicated panel section
- [ ] Basic panel example with questions
- [ ] Nested panels example (2-3 levels deep)
- [ ] Collapsible panels demonstration
- [ ] Different panel styling examples
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with all examples
- [ ] Code snippets available for each example
- [ ] All tests achieve >90% coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Update example/src/screens/ExploreScreen.tsx
- Use Panel components from library
- Follow patterns from existing Explore tab sections
- Import from react-native-survey-js-ui locally

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Component catalog structure in ExploreScreen
- Example data patterns from componentCatalog.ts
- Screen layout patterns from existing screens
- Navigation patterns between examples

### Implementation Notes

1. **Example Structure**
   - Create panel examples in surveyExamples.ts
   - Add new section to component catalog
   - Include variety of panel configurations
   - Use realistic question content

2. **Panel Configurations**
   - Simple panel with 3-4 questions
   - Nested panels (parent -> child -> grandchild)
   - Collapsible panels with different states
   - Panels with different visual styles
   - Empty panel handling example

3. **Interactive Features**
   - Toggle all panels button
   - State persistence demonstration
   - Dynamic panel addition (if applicable)
   - Performance stress test option

4. **Documentation**
   - Code snippets for each example
   - Best practices section
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
   - Performance considerations

## Subtasks
- [ ] Write tests for Explore tab panel section
- [ ] Create panel example data structures
- [ ] Add panel section to ExploreScreen
- [ ] Implement basic panel examples
- [ ] Add nested panel demonstrations
- [ ] Create interactive controls for panels
- [ ] Add code snippet displays
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android devices

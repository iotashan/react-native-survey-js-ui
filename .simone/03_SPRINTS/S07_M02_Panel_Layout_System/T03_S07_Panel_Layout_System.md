# Task: Panel Layout System

## Description
Build a comprehensive responsive panel styling system that provides proper spacing, indentation for nested panels, and mobile-optimized layouts. This system will ensure panels look great across different screen sizes and maintain visual hierarchy for nested structures.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create responsive panel layout system using React Native StyleSheet
- Implement proper spacing and padding for panel content
- Add visual indentation for nested panel hierarchy
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Provide theme-able styling approach for customization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Panel layout adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] Nested panels show clear visual hierarchy through indentation
- [ ] Spacing between questions and panels is consistent
- [ ] Panel borders/backgrounds clearly delineate groups
- [ ] Layout works well in both portrait and landscape orientations
- [ ] Styling system is modular and reusable
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with deeply nested panels
- [ ] All tests achieve >90% coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Use React Native's Dimensions API for responsive sizing
- Follow StyleSheet patterns from existing components
- Consider using context for theme/styling configuration
- Integrate with Panel and PanelHeader components

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- StyleSheet organization from Survey/SurveyPage components
- Consistent spacing units (follow existing marginBottom: 16 pattern)
- Color scheme from existing components
- Flexbox layouts for responsive design

### Implementation Notes

1. **Responsive Design Strategy**
   - Use Dimensions.get('window') for breakpoints
   - Consider orientation changes with event listeners
   - Implement percentage-based widths where appropriate
   - Test on various screen sizes

2. **Nesting Visual Hierarchy**
   - Implement indentation multiplier based on nesting level
   - Consider left padding or margin for nested panels
   - Use subtle background colors or borders for depth
   - Maximum nesting level considerations

3. **Styling Architecture**
   - Create panelStyles.ts for centralized styles
   - Support style composition for variants
   - Allow style overrides through props
   - Consider RTL language support

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Use StyleSheet.create for optimization
   - Avoid inline styles in render methods
   - Consider memoization for complex calculations
   - Test with many panels on lower-end devices

## Subtasks
- [ ] Write tests for responsive layout behavior
- [ ] Create base panel styling with borders and spacing
- [ ] Implement responsive breakpoint system
- [ ] Add nesting level calculation and indentation logic
- [ ] Create visual hierarchy through colors/shadows
- [ ] Test layouts on various screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Document styling system and customization approach
- [ ] Optimize performance for complex panel structures

# Task: Panel Layout System

## Description
Build a comprehensive responsive panel styling system that provides proper spacing, indentation for nested panels, and mobile-optimized layouts. This system will ensure panels look great across different screen sizes and maintain visual hierarchy for nested structures.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create responsive panel layout system using React Native StyleSheet
- Implement proper spacing and padding for panel content
- Add visual indentation for nested panel hierarchy
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Provide theme-able styling approach for customization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Panel layout adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] Nested panels show clear visual hierarchy through indentation
- [ ] Spacing between questions and panels is consistent
- [ ] Panel borders/backgrounds clearly delineate groups
- [ ] Layout works well in both portrait and landscape orientations
- [ ] Styling system is modular and reusable
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with deeply nested panels
- [ ] All tests achieve >90% coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Use React Native's Dimensions API for responsive sizing
- Follow StyleSheet patterns from existing components
- Consider using context for theme/styling configuration
- Integrate with Panel and PanelHeader components

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- StyleSheet organization from Survey/SurveyPage components
- Consistent spacing units (follow existing marginBottom: 16 pattern)
- Color scheme from existing components
- Flexbox layouts for responsive design

### Implementation Notes

1. **Responsive Design Strategy**
   - Use Dimensions.get('window') for breakpoints
   - Consider orientation changes with event listeners
   - Implement percentage-based widths where appropriate
   - Test on various screen sizes

2. **Nesting Visual Hierarchy**
   - Implement indentation multiplier based on nesting level
   - Consider left padding or margin for nested panels
   - Use subtle background colors or borders for depth
   - Maximum nesting level considerations

3. **Styling Architecture**
   - Create panelStyles.ts for centralized styles
   - Support style composition for variants
   - Allow style overrides through props
   - Consider RTL language support

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Use StyleSheet.create for optimization
   - Avoid inline styles in render methods
   - Consider memoization for complex calculations
   - Test with many panels on lower-end devices

## Subtasks
- [x] Write tests for responsive layout behavior
- [x] Create base panel styling with borders and spacing
- [x] Implement responsive breakpoint system
- [x] Add nesting level calculation and indentation logic
- [x] Create visual hierarchy through colors/shadows
- [x] Test layouts on various screen sizes and orientations
- [x] Document styling system and customization approach
- [x] Optimize performance for complex panel structures

## Output Log
[2025-06-08 22:14]: Started implementation of Panel Layout System following TDD approach
[2025-06-08 22:14]: Created comprehensive tests for panel styles including responsive breakpoints, nested styling, and performance
[2025-06-08 22:14]: Implemented panelStyles.ts with responsive design, theme support, and RTL layouts
[2025-06-08 22:14]: Created integration tests for Panel component with new styling system
[2025-06-08 22:14]: Updated Panel component to use new styling system with orientation support
[2025-06-08 22:14]: Exported styling utilities and types from Panel index
[2025-06-08 22:14]: Created comprehensive documentation for the panel styling system
[2025-06-08 22:14]: All tests passing with full coverage

[2025-06-08 22:18]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - Implementation meets all requirements with one minor beneficial addition.
**Scope:** Task T03_S07 - Panel Layout System implementation for Sprint S07
**Findings:** 
  - README.md documentation created (not explicitly required) - Severity: 1/10
  - All task requirements implemented correctly
  - All acceptance criteria met
  - TDD approach followed throughout
  - Test coverage exceeds 90% requirement
  - Code follows all technical guidance
**Summary:** The implementation successfully delivers all required functionality for the Panel Layout System. The code provides responsive design, nested panel support, theme customization, RTL support, and performance optimizations exactly as specified. The addition of README.md documentation, while not explicitly required, enhances developer experience without conflicting with any requirements.
**Recommendation:** Accept the implementation as-is. The README.md addition is beneficial and aligns with good documentation practices. All core requirements have been met with high quality.

# Task: Panel Hierarchy Rendering

## Description
Implement the core logic for rendering nested panel hierarchies with correct parent-child relationships. This task focuses on the recursive rendering algorithm and maintaining proper component tree structure for arbitrarily nested panels.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement recursive panel rendering algorithm
- Maintain correct parent-child relationships in component tree
- Handle circular reference prevention
- Pass nesting level context to child panels
- Ensure proper key management for React reconciliation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Panels can contain other panels to arbitrary depth
- [x] Each panel maintains its nesting level context
- [x] Circular references are detected and handled gracefully
- [x] React keys are properly managed for nested structures
- [x] Component tree reflects survey model hierarchy
- [x] Performance remains acceptable with deep nesting
- [x] All tests achieve >90% coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [x] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [x] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [x] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [x] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [x] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend Panel component from T01 with recursive rendering
- Use React Context API for nesting level tracking
- Follow recursive patterns similar to file tree components
- Integrate with survey-core's panel.panels array

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Component composition patterns from Survey/SurveyPage
- Context usage patterns (if any in existing code)
- Error boundary patterns for safe rendering
- Key generation strategies from existing lists

### Implementation Notes

1. **Recursive Rendering Strategy**
   - Panel component renders its questions first
   - Then maps over panel.panels array
   - Each child panel receives incremented nesting level
   - Use React.memo for optimization if needed

2. **Context Implementation**
   - Create PanelNestingContext for level tracking
   - Provide nesting level to all child components
   - Use for styling calculations in child panels
   - Consider panel path tracking for debugging

3. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Maximum nesting depth constant (e.g., 10 levels)
   - Circular reference detection using Set/Map
   - Graceful degradation when limits exceeded
   - Clear error messages for development

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Test simple one-level nesting
   - Test deep nesting scenarios
   - Test circular reference handling
   - Test performance with many nested panels
   - Mock complex panel structures

## Subtasks
- [x] Write tests for nested panel rendering scenarios
- [x] Create PanelNestingContext for level tracking
- [x] Implement recursive rendering in Panel component
- [x] Add circular reference detection logic
- [x] Implement maximum nesting depth limits
- [x] Add proper React key generation for nested panels
- [x] Test performance with complex hierarchies
- [x] Document nesting limitations and best practices

## Output Log

### Task Completed: 2025-06-08

Successfully implemented panel hierarchy rendering with the following features:

1. **PanelNestingContext Implementation**
   - Created `PanelNestingContext.tsx` to track nesting levels and panel paths
   - Context tracks: nestingLevel, panelPath, panelNamesInPath, maxNestingDepth
   - Provides efficient circular reference detection using Set

2. **Recursive Panel Rendering**
   - Updated Panel component to use context-based nesting
   - Panels can contain other panels to arbitrary depth
   - Each nested panel receives proper context with incremented nesting level
   - React keys are generated based on panel path for stability

3. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Maximum nesting depth limit (default: 10 levels)
   - Circular reference detection prevents infinite loops
   - Console warnings for exceeded depth and circular references
   - Graceful degradation when limits are exceeded

4. **Testing**
   - Created comprehensive test suite in `Panel.hierarchy.test.tsx`
   - Tests cover: nesting levels, circular references, max depth, performance
   - Created `PanelNestingContext.test.tsx` for context functionality
   - All 117 Panel tests passing with >90% coverage

5. **Documentation**
   - Created `PANEL_HIERARCHY.md` documenting the implementation
   - Includes architecture overview, usage examples, and best practices

### Key Implementation Details:
- Used React Context API for efficient nesting level tracking
- Memoized context values to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Fixed hook consistency issues by ensuring hooks are called before early returns
- Unique keys include panel path and index for handling duplicate names

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/Panel/Panel.tsx` - Added context support and hierarchy logic
- `src/components/Panel/PanelNestingContext.tsx` - New context implementation
- `src/components/Panel/__tests__/Panel.hierarchy.test.tsx` - New test suite
- `src/components/Panel/__tests__/PanelNestingContext.test.tsx` - Context tests
- `src/components/Panel/PANEL_HIERARCHY.md` - Documentation
- `src/components/Panel/index.ts` - Exported new context utilities

### Performance Metrics:
- Deep nesting (8 levels): < 100ms render time
- Wide structures (20 siblings): < 100ms render time
- Efficient circular reference detection using Set lookup

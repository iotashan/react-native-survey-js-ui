# Task: Panel Hierarchy Rendering

## Description
Implement the core logic for rendering nested panel hierarchies with correct parent-child relationships. This task focuses on the recursive rendering algorithm and maintaining proper component tree structure for arbitrarily nested panels.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement recursive panel rendering algorithm
- Maintain correct parent-child relationships in component tree
- Handle circular reference prevention
- Pass nesting level context to child panels
- Ensure proper key management for React reconciliation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Panels can contain other panels to arbitrary depth
- [ ] Each panel maintains its nesting level context
- [ ] Circular references are detected and handled gracefully
- [ ] React keys are properly managed for nested structures
- [ ] Component tree reflects survey model hierarchy
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with deep nesting
- [ ] All tests achieve >90% coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend Panel component from T01 with recursive rendering
- Use React Context API for nesting level tracking
- Follow recursive patterns similar to file tree components
- Integrate with survey-core's panel.panels array

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Component composition patterns from Survey/SurveyPage
- Context usage patterns (if any in existing code)
- Error boundary patterns for safe rendering
- Key generation strategies from existing lists

### Implementation Notes

1. **Recursive Rendering Strategy**
   - Panel component renders its questions first
   - Then maps over panel.panels array
   - Each child panel receives incremented nesting level
   - Use React.memo for optimization if needed

2. **Context Implementation**
   - Create PanelNestingContext for level tracking
   - Provide nesting level to all child components
   - Use for styling calculations in child panels
   - Consider panel path tracking for debugging

3. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Maximum nesting depth constant (e.g., 10 levels)
   - Circular reference detection using Set/Map
   - Graceful degradation when limits exceeded
   - Clear error messages for development

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Test simple one-level nesting
   - Test deep nesting scenarios
   - Test circular reference handling
   - Test performance with many nested panels
   - Mock complex panel structures

## Subtasks
- [ ] Write tests for nested panel rendering scenarios
- [ ] Create PanelNestingContext for level tracking
- [ ] Implement recursive rendering in Panel component
- [ ] Add circular reference detection logic
- [ ] Implement maximum nesting depth limits
- [ ] Add proper React key generation for nested panels
- [ ] Test performance with complex hierarchies
- [ ] Document nesting limitations and best practices

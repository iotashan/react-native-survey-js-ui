# Task: PanelHeader Component

## Description
Implement the PanelHeader component that provides title display and collapse/expand functionality for panels. This component will include smooth animations and proper accessibility support for React Native, enhancing the user experience when working with grouped questions.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create PanelHeader component with title and description display
- Implement collapse/expand toggle functionality with smooth animations
- Add proper accessibility labels and hints
- Support customizable expand/collapse icons
- Ensure state persistence for collapsed/expanded states

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PanelHeader displays panel title and optional description
- [ ] Collapse/expand toggle works with smooth animations
- [ ] Collapsed state properly hides panel content
- [ ] Accessibility labels describe current state (expanded/collapsed)
- [ ] Component supports custom styling through props
- [ ] Animation performance is smooth on both iOS and Android
- [ ] State changes are properly communicated to parent Panel
- [ ] All tests achieve >90% coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Use React Native's Animated API for smooth animations
- Import TouchableOpacity/Pressable for interactive header
- Use AccessibilityInfo for proper screen reader support
- Follow icon patterns from existing components (if any)

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Component structure similar to PageNavigation component
- Use testID props consistently
- Follow StyleSheet patterns from existing components
- Handle animation values with useRef and Animated.Value

### Implementation Notes

1. **Animation Setup**
   - Use Animated.View for collapsible content
   - Implement height animation or opacity fade
   - Consider using LayoutAnimation for simpler approach
   - Ensure animations are disabled if user prefers reduced motion

2. **Accessibility Implementation**
   - accessibilityRole="button" for header
   - accessibilityState={{expanded: boolean}}
   - accessibilityHint describing action
   - Proper focus management after toggle

3. **State Management**
   - Local state for expanded/collapsed
   - Callback prop for parent notification
   - Consider controlled/uncontrolled patterns

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Test toggle functionality
   - Test animation triggers
   - Test accessibility properties
   - Test with/without title and description
   - Mock Animated API for testing

## Subtasks
- [ ] Write tests for PanelHeader component behavior
- [ ] Implement basic header with title/description display
- [ ] Add collapse/expand toggle functionality
- [ ] Implement smooth animations for state transitions
- [ ] Add comprehensive accessibility support
- [ ] Create customizable icon components for expand/collapse
- [ ] Integrate with Panel component from T01
- [ ] Performance test animations on both platforms

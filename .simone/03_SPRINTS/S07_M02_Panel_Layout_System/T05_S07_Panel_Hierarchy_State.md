# Task: Panel Hierarchy State Management

## Description
Implement state management for nested panel hierarchies, focusing on maintaining and synchronizing collapsed/expanded states across the panel tree. This includes handling state persistence and proper event propagation through the hierarchy.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement hierarchical state management for panel expansion
- Support independent and synchronized collapse/expand modes
- Handle state persistence across navigation
- Implement proper event bubbling/capturing
- Provide callbacks for state change notifications

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each panel maintains independent collapsed/expanded state
- [ ] Parent panel can control child panel states (optional)
- [ ] State persists during survey navigation
- [ ] State changes trigger appropriate callbacks
- [ ] "Collapse all" / "Expand all" functionality works
- [ ] State synchronization doesn't cause performance issues
- [ ] All tests achieve >90% coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend PanelHeader component with state management
- Use React Context or prop drilling for state sharing
- Consider using useReducer for complex state logic
- Integrate with survey-core's state if available

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- State management patterns from usePageNavigation hook
- Event handling patterns from Survey component
- Callback patterns from existing components
- State persistence approaches (if any)

### Implementation Notes

1. **State Architecture**
   - Create usePanelState hook for state logic
   - Support controlled and uncontrolled modes
   - Use Map/Object for tracking multiple panel states
   - Consider performance with many panels

2. **Event System**
   - onPanelToggle callback for state changes
   - Support preventing default behavior
   - Bubble events through panel hierarchy
   - Batch state updates for performance

3. **Persistence Strategy**
   - Store state keyed by panel names/ids
   - Restore state when panels mount
   - Clear state on survey completion
   - Handle dynamic panel visibility

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement expand/collapse all functionality
   - Support keyboard shortcuts (if applicable)
   - Animation coordination for multiple panels
   - State snapshot/restore capabilities

## Subtasks
- [ ] Write tests for panel state management scenarios
- [ ] Create usePanelState hook with basic functionality
- [ ] Implement state persistence mechanism
- [ ] Add event system for state change notifications
- [ ] Implement collapse/expand all functionality
- [ ] Integrate state management with Panel components
- [ ] Test state synchronization performance
- [ ] Document state management API and patterns

# Task: Panel State Management

## Description
Add focused panel-level state management for individual panel collapsed/expanded states with persistence and proper event handling. This task implements the core state logic that will be used by the panel hierarchy.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create state management utilities for panel expansion states
- Implement state persistence across page navigation
- Add proper TypeScript types for panel state
- Ensure clean API for state access and updates
- Support both controlled and uncontrolled panel modes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Panel state hook manages collapsed/expanded states
- [x] State persists when navigating between pages
- [x] Controlled mode works with external state
- [x] Uncontrolled mode manages internal state
- [x] TypeScript types fully define state shape
- [x] State updates are performant
- [x] All tests achieve >90% coverage

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [x] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [x] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [x] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [x] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [x] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Create hooks in src/hooks/ directory
- Follow patterns from useSurveyState and usePageNavigation
- Use React.useState and React.useCallback
- Consider React.useRef for persistence

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Hook structure from existing hooks directory
- TypeScript patterns from types directory
- Export patterns from hooks/index.ts
- Testing patterns from hooks test files

### Implementation Notes

1. **Hook Implementation**
   - Create usePanelState hook
   - Accept initial state and panel ID
   - Return state and toggle function
   - Handle undefined/null cases gracefully

2. **State Shape**
   ```typescript
   interface PanelState {
     [panelId: string]: boolean; // true = expanded
   }
   ```

3. **API Design**
   - Simple toggle(panelId) function
   - getState(panelId) for reading
   - setState for controlled mode
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Testing Focus**
   - Test state initialization
   - Test toggle functionality
   - Test persistence behavior
   - Test controlled vs uncontrolled
   - Test edge cases

## Subtasks
- [x] Write tests for usePanelState hook
- [x] Implement basic state management hook
- [x] Add TypeScript interfaces for panel state
- [x] Implement controlled component pattern
- [x] Add state persistence logic
- [x] Export hook from hooks index
- [x] Update documentation with usage examples

## Output Log
[2025-06-09 05:34]: Task analysis complete. Found that Panel State Management is already fully implemented:
- usePanelState hook exists with comprehensive functionality
- PanelStateContext and PanelStateProvider are implemented  
- Panel component integrates with state management context
- Tests achieve >98% coverage for usePanelState hook
- Panel state integration tests pass successfully
- All acceptance criteria have been met

[2025-06-09 05:38]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - Implementation meets and exceeds all requirements.
**Scope:** T06_S07 Panel State Management - Review of implementation completed in commits 7170a1e and 3098269.
**Findings:** 
- No deviations from specifications (Severity: 0)
- Additional enhancements implemented beyond requirements (Severity: 1):
  * Hierarchical state management support
  * Cascade collapse functionality  
  * Batch operations for performance
  * Expand all/collapse all operations
- Current working directory contains only minor style improvements (Severity: 0)
**Summary:** The Panel State Management implementation fully satisfies all requirements specified in T06_S07. The implementation provides all required functionality including state persistence, TypeScript types, controlled/uncontrolled modes, and achieves 98.66% test coverage. Additional features enhance the solution without deviating from core requirements.
**Recommendation:** Accept the implementation as complete. The additional features improve the developer experience and performance without breaking the specified API contract.

# Sprint: Panel Layout System (S07)

## Sprint Goal
Implement Panel component system for question grouping and advanced layout capabilities

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Create base Panel component with support for logical question grouping
- Implement PanelHeader component with collapse/expand functionality
- Build responsive panel styling and layout system for React Native
- Add nested panel support with proper hierarchy rendering
- Implement panel-level state management for collapsed/expanded states
- Add comprehensive panel functionality demonstration to Explore tab

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Panel component renders question groups with proper layout and styling
- PanelHeader supports collapse/expand with smooth animations and state persistence
- Panel layout system provides responsive design across different screen sizes
- Nested panels render correctly with proper hierarchy and indentation
- Panel state management handles collapsed/expanded states reliably
- Explore tab demonstrates all panel capabilities with real-world examples
- All components follow TDD approach with >90% test coverage
- Integration with S06 page navigation system works seamlessly

## Tasks

### T01_S07 - Panel Component (Medium Complexity)
Create base Panel component with support for question grouping, nested panels, and integration with survey-core panel models.

### T02_S07 - PanelHeader Component (Medium Complexity)
Implement PanelHeader with collapse/expand functionality, proper animations, and accessibility support for React Native.

### T03_S07 - Panel Layout System (Medium Complexity)
Build responsive panel styling system with proper spacing, indentation for nesting, and mobile-optimized layouts.

### T04_S07 - Panel Hierarchy Rendering (Medium Complexity)
Implement the core logic for rendering nested panel hierarchies with correct parent-child relationships and recursive rendering algorithm.

### T05_S07 - Panel Hierarchy State Management (Medium Complexity)
Implement state management for nested panel hierarchies, including maintaining and synchronizing collapsed/expanded states across the panel tree.

### T06_S07 - Panel State Management (Low Complexity)
Add focused panel-level state management for individual panel collapsed/expanded states with persistence and proper event handling.

### T07_S07 - Explore Tab Panel Demo (Low Complexity)
Add comprehensive panel functionality demonstration to Explore tab with nested panels, different layouts, and interactive examples.

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint adds sophisticated layout capabilities to the survey system
- Focus on mobile-first responsive design for panels
- Ensure panel system integrates well with page navigation from S06
- Panel collapse/expand should provide smooth user experience
- Original T04 (High Complexity) was split into T04, T05, and T06 for better task management
- All tasks are now Medium or Low complexity to ensure manageable scope

# Sprint: Validation Framework (S08)

## Sprint Goal
Establish foundational validation system with error handling and custom validation support

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Create ValidationProvider context for centralized validation state management
- Build ValidationError component for consistent error message display
- Implement required field validation with real-time and on-submit modes
- Add validation timing options (real-time vs on-submit validation)
- Establish foundation for custom validation rule support system
- Create comprehensive integration testing for validation across all components
- Add validation examples to both Survey Demo and Explore tabs

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- ValidationProvider context manages validation state across survey components
- ValidationError component displays error messages with proper UX and accessibility
- Required field validation works correctly in both real-time and on-submit modes
- Validation timing can be configured per survey or per question as needed
- Custom validation rule foundation supports extensible validation patterns
- Integration testing validates validation behavior across page and panel systems
- Sample app demonstrates validation features with comprehensive examples
- All components follow TDD approach with >90% test coverage
- Validation system integrates seamlessly with S06 page navigation and S07 panels

## Tasks

### T01_S08 - ValidationProvider Context (Medium Complexity)
Create ValidationProvider context for centralized validation state management with support for validation rules, errors, and timing modes.

### T02_S08 - ValidationError Component (Low Complexity)
Build ValidationError component for consistent error message display with proper styling, accessibility, and React Native optimization.

### T03_S08 - Required Field Validation (Medium Complexity)
Implement required field validation logic with integration to survey-core validation system and support for different question types.

### T04_S08 - Realtime OnSubmit Modes (Medium Complexity)
Add validation timing options supporting real-time validation, on-submit validation, and hybrid approaches with proper UX patterns.

### T05_S08 - Custom Validation Foundation (Medium Complexity)
Establish extensible custom validation rule support system that integrates with survey-core and supports React Native patterns.

### T06_S08 - Integration Testing (High Complexity)
Create comprehensive integration testing suite that validates validation behavior across page navigation, panel layouts, and question types.

### T07_S08 - Sample App Validation Examples (Low Complexity)
Add comprehensive validation examples to both Survey Demo and Explore tabs demonstrating all validation features and edge cases.

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint completes the core M02 functionality with validation
- Focus on creating extensible validation patterns for future question types
- Integration testing (T06) is critical - ensure validation works across all M02 components
- Validation UX should feel natural and not intrusive in mobile environment
- Foundation should support advanced validation features planned for future milestones

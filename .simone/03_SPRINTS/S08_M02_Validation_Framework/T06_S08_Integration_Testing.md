# Task: Validation Navigation Integration Testing

## Description
Create integration tests specifically for validation system working with page navigation components. This focuses on ensuring validation properly blocks or allows navigation, maintains state across pages, and provides appropriate user feedback during page transitions.

## Goal / Objectives
- Validate that page navigation respects validation state
- Test validation blocking navigation on errors
- Ensure validation state persists across pages
- Test page-level validation before navigation
- Verify proper error display during navigation attempts
- Ensure navigation buttons reflect validation state

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests for validation blocking Next button on errors
- [ ] Tests for validation allowing navigation when valid
- [ ] Tests for page-level validation triggers
- [ ] Tests for validation state persistence across pages
- [ ] Tests for navigation button state based on validation
- [ ] Tests for error message display on navigation attempt
- [ ] Tests for multi-page validation flow
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for navigation integration

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Test with S06 PageNavigation components
- Test with S07 Panel components
- Integrate all validation components from S08
- Use existing test utilities from `src/test-utils/`
- Follow patterns from `src/__tests__/integration/`

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
import { render, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import { mockSurveyModel } from '../../test-utils/surveyFactories';
import { Survey } from '../../components/Survey';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Integration test patterns from navigation-flow.test.tsx
- Test utilities from test-utils directory
- Mock patterns from __mocks__ directory
- Performance testing approaches

### Error Handling Approach
- Test validation error propagation
- Test error boundary behavior
- Test network failure scenarios
- Test invalid validation configurations

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Create test suites for each integration point
2. Test validation + navigation scenarios
3. Test validation + panel hierarchies
4. Test cross-field validation
5. Add performance test suite
6. Create error scenario tests
7. Add accessibility tests
8. Document test patterns

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Organize tests by integration scenario
- Use realistic survey configurations
- Test both happy and error paths
- Focus on user journey testing

### Testing Approach
- Integration tests over unit tests
- Real component rendering
- Minimal mocking for realistic tests
- Performance benchmarking included

### Performance Considerations
- Test with large survey models
- Measure validation performance
- Test memory usage patterns
- Optimize test execution time

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create test suite for validation blocking navigation
- [ ] Test Next button disabled state with validation errors
- [ ] Test Previous button always enabled behavior
- [ ] Test page validation on navigation attempt
- [ ] Test validation state persistence when navigating back
- [ ] Test error message display on blocked navigation
- [ ] Test multi-page form with validation on each page
- [ ] Test navigation with different validation modes
- [ ] Document navigation validation patterns

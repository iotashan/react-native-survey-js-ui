# Task: ValidationError Component

## Description
Build a reusable ValidationError component for consistent error message display across all question types and form elements. This component will handle proper styling, animations, accessibility features, and React Native platform-specific optimizations for displaying validation errors.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a consistent, reusable error display component
- Ensure proper accessibility with screen reader support
- Implement smooth animations for error appearance/disappearance
- Support different error display modes (inline, tooltip, etc.)
- Optimize for React Native performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ValidationError component displays error messages with consistent styling
- [ ] Component supports accessibility with proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
- [ ] Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations for error messages
- [ ] Support for multiple error messages per field
- [ ] Platform-specific styling for iOS and Android
- [ ] Component is reusable across all question types
- [ ] Error messages are properly positioned relative to input fields
- [ ] Component handles long error messages gracefully

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Use `ValidationError` interface from `src/hooks/usePageValidation.tsx`
- Integrate with BaseQuestion component pattern from `src/components/Questions/BaseQuestion/BaseQuestion.tsx`
- Follow component structure patterns from existing components
- Support integration with all question type components

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
import { View, Text, Animated, StyleSheet, Platform } from 'react-native';
import type { ValidationError } from '../../hooks/usePageValidation';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Component structure similar to `ProgressIndicator` component
- Styling patterns using StyleSheet.create
- Animation patterns using React Native's Animated API
- Test patterns from existing component tests

### Error Handling Approach
- Gracefully handle empty or undefined error messages
- Support array of error messages
- Handle different error types (required, format, custom)
- Ensure errors are visually associated with their fields

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Create ValidationError component structure
2. Define TypeScript props interface
3. Implement basic error text rendering
4. Add styling with platform-specific adjustments
5. Implement fade animations
6. Add accessibility properties
7. Handle multiple error messages
8. Create comprehensive test suite

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Use React Native's Animated API for smooth transitions
- Support both single and multiple error messages
- Make component purely presentational (no business logic)
- Enable flexible positioning through props

### Testing Approach
- Snapshot tests for visual consistency
- Accessibility tests for screen reader support
- Animation tests using timers
- Platform-specific rendering tests

### Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize animations for 60 FPS
- Minimize style calculations
- Use native driver for animations when possible

## Subtasks
- [x] Create ValidationError.tsx component file with TypeScript interface
- [x] Implement basic error message rendering
- [x] Add StyleSheet with error text styling
- [x] Implement fade-in/fade-out animations
- [x] Add platform-specific style adjustments
- [x] Implement accessibility properties and labels
- [x] Add support for multiple error messages
- [x] Create test suite with snapshot and behavior tests
- [x] Add usage examples in component documentation

[2025-06-09 07:54] All subtasks completed - ValidationError component fully implemented
[2025-06-09 07:41] Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - ValidationError component implementation meets all requirements and acceptance criteria.
**Scope:** T02_S08 ValidationError Component - reviewing ValidationError.tsx, test files, and integration.
**Findings:** Component fully satisfies all acceptance criteria. Minor deviation: component located at src/components/ValidationError/ vs suggested src/components/Validation/ but follows established codebase patterns (Severity 2).
**Summary:** Implementation is complete and high-quality with comprehensive testing (26 tests), proper accessibility, animations, platform support, and follows TDD approach.
**Recommendation:** PASS - Ready for task completion. Component is ready for integration in subsequent validation tasks.

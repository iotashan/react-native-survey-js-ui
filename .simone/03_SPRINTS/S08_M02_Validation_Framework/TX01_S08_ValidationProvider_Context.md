# Task: ValidationProvider Context

## Description
Create a ValidationProvider context component that will serve as the centralized validation state management system for the entire survey application. This context will manage validation rules, error states, validation timing modes, and provide methods for triggering validation across the survey hierarchy.

## Goal / Objectives
- Establish a centralized validation state management system using React Context
- Support multiple validation timing modes (real-time, on-submit, hybrid)
- Integrate seamlessly with survey-core's validation system
- Provide validation methods accessible throughout the component tree
- Enable efficient error state management with minimal re-renders

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ValidationProvider context component created with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Context provides validation state including errors, touched fields, and validation mode
- [ ] Support for real-time, on-submit, and hybrid validation modes
- [ ] Integration with survey-core's validation events and API
- [ ] Efficient re-render optimization using proper React patterns
- [ ] Context accessible via useValidation hook
- [ ] Validation state persists across page navigation
- [ ] Clear methods for triggering validation at different levels

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend existing `Model` type from survey-core for validation integration
- Build on patterns from `src/hooks/usePageValidation.tsx` which already has `ValidationError` and `ValidationState` interfaces
- Integrate with `src/components/Survey/Survey.tsx` as the top-level provider location
- Use similar patterns to existing contexts in the codebase

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
import type { Model, Question, PageModel, Panel } from 'survey-core';
import type { ValidationError, ValidationState } from '../hooks/usePageValidation';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Context pattern similar to React's built-in contexts
- Hook pattern following existing hooks like `useSurveyModel` and `useSurveyState`
- Error handling patterns from `usePageValidation` hook
- State management patterns using useState and useReducer as appropriate

### Error Handling Approach
- Follow error structure already defined in `ValidationError` interface
- Use survey-core's built-in validation error messages when available
- Support custom error message overrides
- Handle async validation scenarios

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Create ValidationContext with proper TypeScript types
2. Define ValidationProvider component with state management
3. Implement validation mode switching logic
4. Create useValidation hook for context consumption
5. Add validation event listeners for survey-core integration
6. Implement validation trigger methods
7. Add optimization for re-render performance
8. Create comprehensive test suite

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Use React Context API for global validation state
- Separate validation logic from UI components
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous validation
- Enable field-level and form-level validation

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for context provider logic
- Integration tests with survey-core validation
- Performance tests for re-render optimization
- Mock survey models for isolated testing

### Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo for provider optimization
- Implement selective state updates to minimize re-renders
- Consider using useReducer for complex state management
- Batch validation updates when possible

## Subtasks
- [x] Create ValidationContext.tsx with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Implement ValidationProvider component with initial state
- [x] Add validation mode management (real-time, on-submit, hybrid)
- [x] Create useValidation hook for context consumption
- [x] Integrate with survey-core validation events
- [x] Implement validateField, validatePage, and validateSurvey methods
- [x] Add performance optimizations for re-renders
- [x] Write comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- [x] Add JSDoc documentation for public API

## Output Log

[2025-06-09 06:03:00] Started task
[2025-06-09 06:04:00] Created ValidationContext test file with comprehensive test suite
[2025-06-09 06:05:00] Implemented ValidationContext.tsx with TypeScript interfaces and full functionality
[2025-06-09 06:05:30] Created contexts/index.ts for module exports
[2025-06-09 06:06:00] Fixed test failures - handled duplicate error messages and real-time validation
[2025-06-09 06:07:00] Added extensive edge case and error handling tests
[2025-06-09 06:08:00] Achieved 94.97% code coverage for ValidationContext.tsx
[2025-06-09 06:09:00] Added JSDoc documentation for public API
[2025-06-09 06:09:54] Task completed - all subtasks done

[2025-06-09 06:13]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Deviation from specification found
**Scope:** Task T01_S08 - ValidationProvider Context implementation
**Findings:** 
- Issue 1: Validation state does not persist across page navigation (Severity: 7/10)
  - Requirement: "Validation state persists across page navigation" 
  - Implementation: handleCurrentPageChanged() calls clearErrors() which clears all errors and touched fields
  - Impact: This changes fundamental validation behavior that was explicitly specified
**Summary:** The implementation is well-structured and follows TDD with 94.97% coverage, but deviates from the specification regarding validation state persistence across page navigation.
**Recommendation:** Fix the handleCurrentPageChanged handler to preserve validation state across page navigation. Consider only clearing errors for fields that are no longer visible on the new page, while preserving errors for fields that will be shown again later.

[2025-06-09 06:14:31] Fixed validation state persistence issue - removed clearErrors() from handleCurrentPageChanged
[2025-06-09 06:14:31] Updated tests to verify validation state persists across page navigation
[2025-06-09 06:14:31] All tests passing with 95.08% coverage

[2025-06-09 06:15]: Code Review (Second Pass) - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All requirements now satisfied
**Scope:** Task T01_S08 - ValidationProvider Context implementation (after fixes)
**Findings:** None - All issues resolved
**Summary:** The validation state persistence issue has been fixed. The implementation now correctly preserves validation state across page navigation as required. All other requirements were already satisfied.
**Recommendation:** Task is now complete and ready for finalization.

[2025-06-09 06:15:42] Task completed and status updated to completed

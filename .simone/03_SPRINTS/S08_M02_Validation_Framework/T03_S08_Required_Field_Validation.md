# Task: Required Field Validation

## Description
Implement required field validation logic that integrates with survey-core's validation system. This includes support for different question types, real-time and on-submit validation modes, and proper error message generation for required fields that are left empty or incomplete.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement required field validation for all question types
- Integrate with survey-core's isRequired property and validation
- Support both real-time and on-submit validation timing
- Generate appropriate error messages for different question types
- Handle special cases like checkbox groups and matrix questions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Required validation works for text input questions
- [ ] Required validation works for single-choice questions (radio)
- [ ] Required validation works for multiple-choice questions (checkbox)
- [ ] Required validation respects minimum selection requirements
- [ ] Real-time validation triggers on blur/change as configured
- [ ] On-submit validation prevents navigation with errors
- [ ] Error messages are contextual to question type
- [ ] Integration with ValidationProvider context
- [ ] Survey-core validation events properly handled

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend validation logic in `src/hooks/usePageValidation.tsx`
- Integrate with survey-core's Question.isRequired property
- Use survey-core's validation events (onValidateQuestion, onValidatePanel, onValidatePage)
- Connect with ValidationProvider context from T01
- Work with existing question components in `src/components/Questions/`

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
import type { Model, Question, QuestionValidators } from 'survey-core';
import { usePageValidation } from '../../hooks/usePageValidation';
import { useValidation } from '../../contexts/ValidationContext';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Validation patterns from usePageValidation hook
- Question component patterns from BaseQuestion
- Event handling patterns from useSurveyModel
- Error state management from existing validation state

### Error Handling Approach
- Use survey-core's built-in required validation messages
- Support custom required messages per question
- Handle empty strings, null, undefined as invalid
- Special handling for array-based questions (checkboxes)

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Extend usePageValidation with required field logic
2. Add required validation to BaseQuestion component
3. Implement question-type-specific validation rules
4. Connect to ValidationProvider for state management
5. Add real-time validation triggers
6. Implement on-submit validation flow
7. Create error message generation logic
8. Write comprehensive test coverage

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Leverage survey-core's validation infrastructure
- Centralize validation logic in hooks
- Support pluggable validation for future validators
- Keep validation logic separate from UI components

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for each question type validation
- Integration tests with survey-core
- Test both real-time and on-submit modes
- Mock survey models for isolated testing

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce real-time validation triggers
- Batch validation for multiple fields
- Cache validation results when appropriate
- Minimize validation runs on re-renders

## Subtasks
- [ ] Extend usePageValidation with required field checking
- [ ] Add isRequired validation to BaseQuestion component
- [ ] Implement text question required validation
- [ ] Implement radio button required validation
- [ ] Implement checkbox required validation with min selections
- [ ] Add real-time validation event handlers
- [ ] Implement on-submit validation flow
- [ ] Create contextual error message generation
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite for all question types
- [ ] Document validation behavior and configuration

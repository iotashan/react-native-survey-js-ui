# Task: Validation Panel Integration Testing

## Description
Create integration tests for validation system working with panel components and hierarchies. This ensures validation works correctly within nested panel structures, collapsed panels, and maintains proper state management across panel boundaries.

## Goal / Objectives
- Test validation within panel hierarchies
- Ensure validation works with collapsed/expanded panels
- Test panel-level validation aggregation
- Verify error display within panels
- Test validation state with dynamic panels
- Ensure proper validation UI within panel layouts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests for validation within single panels
- [ ] Tests for validation in nested panel hierarchies
- [ ] Tests for validation with collapsed panels
- [ ] Tests for panel-level validation summary
- [ ] Tests for error display within panels
- [ ] Tests for dynamic panel validation
- [ ] Tests for validation state persistence in panels
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for panel integration

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Test with S07 Panel components
- Integration with ValidationProvider
- Panel collapse/expand state management
- Nested validation aggregation
- Error display within panel boundaries

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
import { Panel } from '../../components/Panel';
import { ValidationProvider } from '../../contexts/ValidationContext';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Panel test patterns from S07
- Integration test structure
- Validation test utilities
- Component hierarchy testing

### Error Handling Approach
- Test error display in collapsed panels
- Test error propagation through panel hierarchy
- Test panel header error indicators
- Test accessibility of panel errors

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Create panel validation test structure
2. Test single panel validation scenarios
3. Test nested panel validation
4. Test collapsed panel behavior
5. Test dynamic panel validation
6. Test error aggregation
7. Test UI indicators
8. Document patterns

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Test realistic panel structures
- Focus on user interactions
- Test state management edge cases
- Ensure mobile-friendly validation UI

### Testing Approach
- Component integration tests
- User interaction simulation
- State verification tests
- Visual regression tests

### Performance Considerations
- Test with deep panel nesting
- Verify efficient re-renders
- Test large panel counts
- Monitor memory usage

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create panel validation test suite structure
- [ ] Test validation in single panel component
- [ ] Test validation in nested panel hierarchy
- [ ] Test validation with collapsed panels
- [ ] Test panel header error indicators
- [ ] Test error message display within panels
- [ ] Test dynamic panel addition/removal
- [ ] Test validation state aggregation
- [ ] Document panel validation patterns

# Task: Setup TypeScript Configuration

## Description
Configure TypeScript for library development with proper compiler options, path mapping, and type generation. This task ensures type safety, excellent developer experience, and proper TypeScript definition generation for library consumers.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish comprehensive TypeScript configuration for library development and distribution.
- Configure tsconfig.json for library compilation with appropriate compiler options
- Set up proper type declaration generation for npm distribution
- Configure path mapping for clean imports within the library
- Ensure TypeScript compilation works seamlessly with React Native

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] tsconfig.json is configured with appropriate compiler options for library development
- [ ] Type declaration files (.d.ts) are generated during build process
- [ ] TypeScript compilation completes without errors
- [ ] Path mapping is configured for clean internal imports
- [ ] TypeScript works correctly with React Native components and APIs
- [ ] Example app can consume library with full TypeScript support

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- TypeScript compiler must output both JavaScript and declaration files
- Configuration should support React Native's Metro bundler
- JSX compilation should target React Native components
- Module resolution should support React Native's resolution algorithm

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use strict TypeScript configuration for better type safety
- Configure for ES2017+ target for modern React Native support
- Enable declaration map generation for debugging
- Set up proper source map generation

**Error handling approach:**
- Validate TypeScript configuration with tsc --noEmit
- Test compilation with different TypeScript versions
- Ensure no type errors in library code

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Review generated tsconfig.json from create-react-native-library
2. Configure compiler options for library development
3. Set up declaration file generation
4. Configure path mapping for internal imports
5. Validate TypeScript compilation
6. Test type checking in example app

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Use strict TypeScript settings for better code quality
- Generate declaration files for excellent consumer experience
- Support both CommonJS and ES module output
- Enable source maps for debugging

**Testing approach:**
- Test TypeScript compilation without errors
- Verify declaration files are generated correctly
- Test type checking in consuming applications

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review and configure compiler options in tsconfig.json
- [ ] Set up declaration file generation with proper output paths
- [ ] Configure path mapping for clean internal imports
- [ ] Set up JSX compilation for React Native
- [ ] Configure module resolution for React Native compatibility
- [ ] Test TypeScript compilation process
- [ ] Verify type definitions work in example app

# Task: Establish Build Process

## Description
Configure and establish the library build process including TypeScript compilation, bundle generation, and distribution preparation. This task ensures the library can be properly built for npm distribution and consumed by other React Native applications.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a robust build process for library development and distribution.
- Configure build scripts for TypeScript compilation and bundle generation
- Set up development build process for rapid iteration
- Configure production build process for npm distribution
- Ensure build output includes all necessary files for consumption

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build scripts are configured in package.json for development and production
- [ ] TypeScript compilation produces JavaScript and declaration files
- [ ] Build process generates proper bundle structure for npm distribution
- [ ] Development build supports rapid iteration with example app
- [ ] Production build optimizes bundle size and performance
- [ ] Build process includes proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Generated build outputs work correctly in consuming applications

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Build process should integrate with TypeScript compiler
- Output should include both CommonJS and ES module formats
- Declaration files must be generated for TypeScript consumers
- Build system should work with React Native Metro bundler

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use standard React Native library build tools and conventions
- Generate multiple output formats (CommonJS, ES modules)
- Include source maps for debugging
- Optimize for tree-shaking in consuming applications

**Error handling approach:**
- Validate TypeScript compilation before build completion
- Check that all required files are included in build output
- Verify build artifacts work in test environments

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Review build configuration generated by create-react-native-library
2. Configure TypeScript compilation for library build
3. Set up development build process for rapid iteration
4. Configure production build process for distribution
5. Test build outputs with example app
6. Validate build process reliability

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Generate both CommonJS and ES module outputs for compatibility
- Include TypeScript declarations for excellent developer experience
- Optimize build output for bundle size and performance
- Support source maps for debugging

**Testing approach:**
- Test build process completes without errors
- Verify generated outputs work in consuming applications
- Test development build supports rapid iteration

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review and configure build scripts in package.json
- [ ] Set up TypeScript compilation for library build
- [ ] Configure development build process for rapid iteration
- [ ] Set up production build process for npm distribution
- [ ] Configure output formats (CommonJS and ES modules)
- [ ] Set up declaration file generation in build process
- [ ] Test build outputs work with example app
- [ ] Validate build process reliability and error handling

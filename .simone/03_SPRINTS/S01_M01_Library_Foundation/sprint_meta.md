# Sprint: Library Foundation Setup (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Initialize React Native library infrastructure with proper npm configuration and TypeScript setup

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Initialize with `create-react-native-library react-native-survey-js-ui`
- Configure package.json for npm distribution
- Set up TypeScript configuration for library development
- Create src/ directory structure with main exports
- Configure peer dependencies (React, React Native)
- Establish basic library build process

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Library builds successfully without errors
- Package structure follows npm publishing standards
- TypeScript compilation works without errors
- Main export (src/index.ts) resolves correctly
- Package.json properly configured with peer dependencies
- Ready for local development workflow integration

## Tasks
- [T01_S01_Initialize_Library_Project.md](./T01_S01_Initialize_Library_Project.md) - Bootstrap React Native library project using create-react-native-library
- [T02_S01_Configure_Package_Json.md](./T02_S01_Configure_Package_Json.md) - Configure package.json for npm distribution with proper metadata
- [T03_S01_Setup_TypeScript_Configuration.md](./T03_S01_Setup_TypeScript_Configuration.md) - Set up TypeScript configuration for library development  
- [T04_S01_Create_Source_Directory_Structure.md](./T04_S01_Create_Source_Directory_Structure.md) - Create src/ directory structure with main exports
- [T05_S01_Configure_Peer_Dependencies.md](./T05_S01_Configure_Peer_Dependencies.md) - Configure React and React Native as peer dependencies
- [T06_S01_Establish_Build_Process.md](./T06_S01_Establish_Build_Process.md) - Establish library build process and scripts

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This is the foundational sprint that enables all subsequent development
- Focus on getting the library infrastructure right from the start
- Ensure proper separation between library code and example app code

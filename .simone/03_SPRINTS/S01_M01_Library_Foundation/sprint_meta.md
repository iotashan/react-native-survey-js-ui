# Sprint: Library Foundation Setup (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Initialize React Native library infrastructure with proper npm configuration and TypeScript setup

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Initialize with `create-react-native-library react-native-survey-js-ui`
- Configure package.json for npm distribution
- Set up TypeScript configuration for library development
- Create src/ directory structure with main exports
- Configure peer dependencies (React, React Native)
- Establish basic library build process

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Library builds successfully without errors
- Package structure follows npm publishing standards
- TypeScript compilation works without errors
- Main export (src/index.ts) resolves correctly
- Package.json properly configured with peer dependencies
- Ready for local development workflow integration

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This is the foundational sprint that enables all subsequent development
- Focus on getting the library infrastructure right from the start
- Ensure proper separation between library code and example app code

# Task: Configure Peer Dependencies

## Description
Configure React and React Native as peer dependencies in package.json to ensure the library integrates properly with consuming applications without bundling conflicting versions of core dependencies.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish proper peer dependency configuration for React Native library distribution.
- Configure React and React Native as peer dependencies
- Set appropriate version ranges for compatibility
- Ensure library doesn't bundle core React Native dependencies
- Document peer dependency requirements for consumers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React is configured as a peer dependency with appropriate version range
- [ ] React Native is configured as a peer dependency with appropriate version range
- [ ] Peer dependencies are not included in regular dependencies
- [ ] Version ranges allow reasonable compatibility with consuming apps
- [ ] Library builds without bundling peer dependencies
- [ ] Example app correctly provides peer dependencies

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Peer dependencies are provided by the consuming React Native application
- Library should not bundle React or React Native in its distribution
- Version ranges should be broad enough for compatibility but specific enough for safety
- Example app should demonstrate proper peer dependency provision

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use caret (^) ranges for peer dependencies to allow compatible minor updates
- Follow React Native library community standards for version ranges
- Ensure peer dependencies align with library's actual usage
- Document minimum supported versions

**Error handling approach:**
- Validate that library doesn't bundle peer dependencies
- Test with different React Native versions within range
- Warn consumers about peer dependency requirements

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Review current dependency configuration in package.json
2. Move React and React Native to peerDependencies section
3. Set appropriate version ranges based on library requirements
4. Remove React/React Native from regular dependencies if present
5. Update example app to provide peer dependencies
6. Test library installation and usage

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Don't bundle core React Native framework in library
- Allow flexibility for consuming apps to use their preferred versions
- Maintain compatibility with reasonable version ranges
- Follow npm peer dependency best practices

**Testing approach:**
- Verify library doesn't include React/React Native in bundle
- Test with different React Native versions
- Validate example app works with peer dependency setup

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review current React and React Native dependency configuration
- [ ] Move React to peerDependencies with appropriate version range
- [ ] Move React Native to peerDependencies with appropriate version range
- [ ] Remove React/React Native from regular dependencies if present
- [ ] Update example app to properly provide peer dependencies
- [ ] Test library builds without bundling peer dependencies
- [ ] Verify library works correctly with peer dependency setup
- [ ] Document peer dependency requirements

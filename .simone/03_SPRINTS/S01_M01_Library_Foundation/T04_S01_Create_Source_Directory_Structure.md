# Task: Create Source Directory Structure

## Description
Establish the src/ directory structure with main exports following React Native library best practices. This task creates the organized foundation for all library components, utilities, and type definitions with proper export strategy.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a well-organized source directory structure that supports scalable library development.
- Create src/ directory structure with components, types, and utils folders
- Set up main index.ts file with public API exports
- Establish component organization following React Native library patterns
- Create placeholder files to demonstrate export structure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] src/ directory contains organized subdirectories (components/, types/, utils/)
- [ ] Main src/index.ts file exports public library API
- [ ] Component directories include index.ts files for clean exports
- [ ] Directory structure follows React Native library conventions
- [ ] Placeholder components demonstrate export patterns
- [ ] Library builds successfully with new directory structure

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- src/index.ts serves as the main library entry point
- Component directories should include both implementation and export files
- Type definitions should be centralized for easy consumption
- Utility functions should be modular and tree-shakable

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use barrel exports (index.ts files) for clean import paths
- Organize components by functionality or type
- Separate types from implementation for better maintainability
- Follow React Native community conventions for library structure

**Error handling approach:**
- Verify all exports are properly typed
- Test import paths work correctly
- Ensure build process includes all necessary files

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create src/ directory with subdirectories: components/, types/, utils/
2. Set up main src/index.ts with public API exports
3. Create placeholder component directories with index.ts files
4. Add basic type definitions in types/ directory
5. Create utility functions structure
6. Test export structure with example app

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Use barrel exports for clean public API
- Organize by feature/component type rather than technical layer
- Maintain clear separation between public and internal APIs
- Support tree-shaking with named exports

**Testing approach:**
- Test that all exports are accessible from main index
- Verify TypeScript can resolve all export paths
- Test import statements in example app

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create src/ directory with components/, types/, utils/ subdirectories
- [ ] Set up main src/index.ts with public API exports
- [ ] Create component directories with index.ts barrel exports
- [ ] Add basic type definitions in src/types/
- [ ] Create utility functions structure in src/utils/
- [ ] Add placeholder components to demonstrate structure
- [ ] Test library builds with new directory structure
- [ ] Verify exports work in example app

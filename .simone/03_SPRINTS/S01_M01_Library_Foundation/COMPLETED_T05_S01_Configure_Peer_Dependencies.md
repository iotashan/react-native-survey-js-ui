# Task: Configure Peer Dependencies

## Description
Configure React and React Native as peer dependencies in package.json to ensure the library integrates properly with consuming applications without bundling conflicting versions of core dependencies.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish proper peer dependency configuration for React Native library distribution.
- Configure React and React Native as peer dependencies
- Set appropriate version ranges for compatibility
- Ensure library doesn't bundle core React Native dependencies
- Document peer dependency requirements for consumers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] React is configured as a peer dependency with appropriate version range
- [x] React Native is configured as a peer dependency with appropriate version range
- [x] Peer dependencies are not included in regular dependencies
- [x] Version ranges allow reasonable compatibility with consuming apps
- [x] Library builds without bundling peer dependencies
- [x] Example app correctly provides peer dependencies

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Peer dependencies are provided by the consuming React Native application
- Library should not bundle React or React Native in its distribution
- Version ranges should be broad enough for compatibility but specific enough for safety
- Example app should demonstrate proper peer dependency provision

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use caret (^) ranges for peer dependencies to allow compatible minor updates
- Follow React Native library community standards for version ranges
- Ensure peer dependencies align with library's actual usage
- Document minimum supported versions

**Error handling approach:**
- Validate that library doesn't bundle peer dependencies
- Test with different React Native versions within range
- Warn consumers about peer dependency requirements

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Review current dependency configuration in package.json
2. Move React and React Native to peerDependencies section
3. Set appropriate version ranges based on library requirements
4. Remove React/React Native from regular dependencies if present
5. Update example app to provide peer dependencies
6. Test library installation and usage

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Don't bundle core React Native framework in library
- Allow flexibility for consuming apps to use their preferred versions
- Maintain compatibility with reasonable version ranges
- Follow npm peer dependency best practices

**Testing approach:**
- Verify library doesn't include React/React Native in bundle
- Test with different React Native versions
- Validate example app works with peer dependency setup

## Subtasks
- [x] Review current React and React Native dependency configuration
- [x] Move React to peerDependencies with appropriate version range
- [x] Move React Native to peerDependencies with appropriate version range
- [x] Remove React/React Native from regular dependencies if present
- [x] Update example app to properly provide peer dependencies
- [x] Test library builds without bundling peer dependencies
- [x] Verify library works correctly with peer dependency setup
- [x] Document peer dependency requirements

## Output Log
[2025-06-04 19:54]: Started task - reviewing current dependency configuration
[2025-06-04 19:55]: Found React and React Native already in peerDependencies with "*" version range
[2025-06-04 19:55]: Example app has React 19.0.0 and React Native 0.79.2 as regular dependencies
[2025-06-04 19:56]: Updated peer dependency version ranges - React >=18.0.0, React Native >=0.70.0
[2025-06-04 19:56]: Verified React/React Native are not in regular dependencies (only in devDependencies for testing)
[2025-06-04 19:57]: Updated example app - added library link, removed web dependencies
[2025-06-04 19:58]: Built library successfully - verified React/React Native imports but not bundled
[2025-06-04 19:59]: All tests passing - library works correctly with peer dependency setup
[2025-06-04 20:00]: Updated README.md with peer dependency requirements documentation
[2025-06-04 20:01]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Deviations from specifications found
**Scope:** Task T05_S01_Configure_Peer_Dependencies - Configuring peer dependencies for React Native library
**Findings:** 
1. Peer dependency version ranges deviate from specification (Severity: 8/10)
   - Milestone spec requires: "react": "*", "react-native": "*"
   - Implemented: "react": ">=18.0.0", "react-native": ">=0.70.0"
   - Task guidance suggested caret (^) ranges, but >= was used instead
2. Removed web dependencies from example app (Severity: 3/10)
   - Not in original requirements but aligns with user clarification
**Summary:** The implementation deviates from the milestone specification for peer dependency version ranges. While the changes may be reasonable, they don't match the documented requirements.
**Recommendation:** Either update the implementation to match the "*" specification or get approval to update the milestone requirements to reflect more specific version ranges.
[2025-06-04 20:02]: Fixed peer dependency version ranges to match specification - changed back to "*"
[2025-06-04 20:02]: Updated README.md to reflect correct peer dependency requirements
[2025-06-04 20:04]: Code Review (Second Pass) - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All requirements met after fixes
**Scope:** Task T05_S01_Configure_Peer_Dependencies - Configuring peer dependencies for React Native library
**Findings:** 
1. Peer dependency version ranges now match specification (Fixed)
   - Required: "react": "*", "react-native": "*"
   - Implemented: "react": "*", "react-native": "*"
2. Web dependencies removed from example app (Acceptable)
   - Aligns with user clarification about no web support needed
**Summary:** After fixing the peer dependency version ranges to match the milestone specification, all requirements are now met. The implementation correctly configures peer dependencies without bundling them.
**Recommendation:** Task is ready for completion. All acceptance criteria have been satisfied.

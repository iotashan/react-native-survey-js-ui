# Task: Configure Package Json

## Description
Configure the library's package.json file for npm distribution with proper metadata, scripts, and dependency configuration. This task ensures the library can be published to npm and consumed by other React Native applications.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish proper npm package configuration for library distribution and consumption.
- Configure package.json with appropriate metadata for npm publishing
- Set up proper main entry points for library consumption
- Define build and test scripts for library development
- Ensure package follows npm best practices for React Native libraries

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Package.json includes proper name, version, description, and author information
- [ ] Main entry point correctly references compiled library output
- [ ] Module entry point is configured for ES modules
- [ ] Types entry point references TypeScript definitions
- [ ] Scripts are defined for build, test, lint, and other development tasks
- [ ] Keywords and repository information are properly configured
- [ ] License information is specified and appropriate

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Package.json main field should point to compiled library output
- Module field should reference ES module build for tree-shaking
- Types field must reference TypeScript definition files
- Files field should include only necessary distribution files

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Follow React Native library conventions for package.json structure
- Use semantic versioning (0.1.0 for initial development)
- Include standard npm scripts for library development workflow
- Configure proper entry points for different module systems

**Error handling approach:**
- Validate package.json syntax using npm or yarn
- Verify entry points reference existing files
- Test package installation in a separate project

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Review generated package.json from create-react-native-library
2. Update metadata fields (name, description, author, repository)
3. Configure proper entry points (main, module, types)
4. Set up build and development scripts
5. Add appropriate keywords for npm discoverability
6. Validate configuration

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Use semantic versioning starting with 0.1.0
- Configure for dual CommonJS/ES module distribution
- Include TypeScript definitions for excellent developer experience
- Optimize for npm package size and tree-shaking

**Testing approach:**
- Validate package.json syntax and structure
- Test entry points reference correct files
- Verify scripts execute without errors

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review and update package name and description
- [ ] Configure main, module, and types entry points
- [ ] Set up build scripts for library compilation
- [ ] Add test, lint, and development scripts
- [ ] Configure repository and author information
- [ ] Add appropriate keywords for npm discoverability
- [ ] Validate package.json configuration

# Task: Cross Platform Testing Configuration

## Description
Configure and implement cross-platform testing infrastructure to ensure the react-native-survey-js-ui library works correctly on both iOS and Android platforms. This includes setting up platform-specific test configurations, simulators/emulators in CI, and validation of platform-specific behavior.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish comprehensive cross-platform testing to guarantee library compatibility:
- Configure iOS simulator testing in CI environment
- Configure Android emulator testing in CI environment
- Set up platform-specific test suites and configurations
- Validate library functionality across both mobile platforms
- Ensure consistent behavior between iOS and Android implementations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] iOS simulator configured and functional in CI environment
- [ ] Android emulator configured and functional in CI environment
- [ ] Platform-specific test suites execute successfully
- [ ] Example app builds and runs tests on both platforms
- [ ] Library components render correctly on both platforms
- [ ] Platform-specific React Native behaviors properly tested
- [ ] CI workflow includes both iOS and Android testing steps
- [ ] Test failures on either platform fail the entire CI build
- [ ] Platform-specific test reports generated and preserved

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- GitHub Actions workflow from T01_S05 for CI integration
- Example app iOS and Android configurations
- Jest configuration with platform-specific test environment setup
- React Native Testing Library for cross-platform component testing
- Detox or similar tool for end-to-end testing if required

### Implementation Notes
- Use GitHub Actions hosted runners with macOS for iOS testing
- Configure Android SDK and emulator setup in CI
- Set up proper platform detection in test utilities
- Configure platform-specific mock strategies for React Native APIs
- Ensure test isolation between platforms
- Consider using test matrix for parallel platform execution

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research cross-platform testing best practices for React Native libraries
- [ ] Configure iOS simulator setup in GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Configure Android emulator setup in GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Create platform-specific test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Set up platform detection and conditional testing logic
- [ ] Configure example app build and test execution for iOS
- [ ] Configure example app build and test execution for Android
- [ ] Add platform-specific component testing for library components
- [ ] Configure test reporting for platform-specific results
- [ ] Validate cross-platform functionality with comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Document cross-platform testing setup and maintenance

# Task: Comprehensive Library Documentation

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation for the react-native-survey-js-ui library including README, API documentation, usage examples, and integration guides. This documentation will serve as the primary resource for developers consuming the library and must provide clear guidance for installation, configuration, and usage.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish complete documentation ecosystem for library adoption:
- Create comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Document all exported components and their APIs
- Provide practical usage examples and code snippets
- Create troubleshooting and FAQ sections
- Ensure documentation is accessible and developer-friendly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README.md created with comprehensive library overview
- [ ] Installation and setup instructions clearly documented
- [ ] All exported components documented with API specifications
- [ ] Practical usage examples provided for common scenarios
- [ ] TypeScript usage guidance and type definitions documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting section addresses common issues
- [ ] Integration examples for different React Native project types
- [ ] Contributing guidelines for library development
- [ ] Documentation follows industry standards and best practices
- [ ] All code examples tested and verified to work

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- Main README.md file in project root for npm package page
- Library source code in `src/` for API documentation
- Example app code in `example/` for usage examples
- TypeScript definitions for API documentation
- Package.json configuration for library metadata

### Implementation Notes
- Follow standard npm package README structure
- Include code examples that can be copy-pasted
- Document peer dependencies and version requirements
- Provide migration guides from other survey solutions
- Include performance considerations and best practices
- Use proper markdown formatting and structure
- Consider adding diagrams or screenshots where helpful

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research React Native library documentation best practices
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md with library overview
- [ ] Document installation and setup process
- [ ] Create API documentation for all exported components
- [ ] Add usage examples for Survey component and question types
- [ ] Document TypeScript integration and type definitions
- [ ] Create troubleshooting and FAQ section
- [ ] Add integration examples for different project configurations
- [ ] Document development workflow and contributing guidelines
- [ ] Review and validate all documentation examples
- [ ] Format and structure documentation for readability

# Task: NPM Distribution Preparation

## Description
Prepare the react-native-survey-js-ui library for npm distribution by configuring package.json for publishing, setting up proper versioning, configuring npm scripts, and establishing the foundation for automated publishing workflow. This includes validating package configuration and preparing for initial npm release.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish complete npm distribution readiness for library publication:
- Configure package.json for npm publishing with proper metadata
- Set up semantic versioning and release workflow foundation
- Validate npm package configuration and file inclusion
- Prepare publishing scripts and automation foundation
- Ensure library is ready for initial npm release

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Package.json configured correctly for npm publishing
- [ ] Proper semantic versioning strategy established
- [ ] NPM publish scripts and configuration validated
- [ ] Package file inclusion/exclusion properly configured
- [ ] Library metadata (description, keywords, repository) complete
- [ ] Npm package validation passes all checks
- [ ] Publishing workflow foundation established
- [ ] Package size optimization completed
- [ ] Pre-publish validation scripts functional
- [ ] Library ready for initial npm release

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- `package.json` configuration for npm publishing
- Build verification system from T03_S05
- Library build artifacts and distribution files
- Semantic versioning and release management tools
- npm registry configuration and publishing workflow

### Implementation Notes
- Configure proper npm package fields (main, types, files, exports)
- Set up .npmignore or files field to control package contents
- Validate package.json configuration with npm pack/publish dry run
- Configure proper peer dependencies and version ranges
- Set up semantic versioning workflow for future releases
- Ensure package size is optimized for npm distribution

## Subtasks
- [ ] Configure package.json fields for npm publishing
- [ ] Set up proper file inclusion/exclusion for package contents
- [ ] Configure semantic versioning strategy and tooling
- [ ] Create npm publishing scripts and validation
- [ ] Set up package metadata and repository information
- [ ] Configure peer dependencies and version requirements
- [ ] Validate npm package configuration with dry run
- [ ] Optimize package size and remove unnecessary files
- [ ] Set up pre-publish validation and quality checks
- [ ] Document npm publishing process and requirements
- [ ] Prepare for initial npm release workflow

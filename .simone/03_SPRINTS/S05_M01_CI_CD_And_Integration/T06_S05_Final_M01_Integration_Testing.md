# Task: Final M01 Integration Testing

## Description
Conduct comprehensive integration testing to validate that all M01 milestone requirements are met and the react-native-survey-js-ui library is ready for production use. This includes end-to-end testing, validation of all delivered components, and verification that the library meets all defined success criteria.

## Goal / Objectives
Validate complete M01 milestone delivery and production readiness:
- Verify all M01 success criteria are met and functional
- Conduct end-to-end testing of library and example app integration
- Validate library can be consumed by external React Native projects
- Ensure all deliverables are complete and properly documented
- Confirm library is ready for npm distribution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All M01 success criteria verified and documented as complete
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests pass for library and example app
- [ ] Library successfully installs and works in fresh React Native project
- [ ] All exported components and APIs function as documented
- [ ] Example app demonstrates all implemented functionality
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable standards for mobile usage
- [ ] All tests pass consistently across multiple test runs
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects implemented functionality
- [ ] Library bundle size and dependencies are optimized
- [ ] Integration with survey-core validated and stable

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- M01 milestone requirements from `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01_Foundation_and_Testing/`
- All completed sprint deliverables from S01-S05
- Library source code and test coverage
- Example app functionality and demonstration capabilities
- CI/CD pipeline from previous tasks for automated validation

### Implementation Notes
- Create comprehensive integration test suite covering all M01 features
- Validate library installation and usage in isolated test environment
- Test library performance with realistic survey data and usage patterns
- Verify cross-platform functionality on both iOS and Android
- Validate TypeScript integration and type safety
- Ensure proper error handling and edge case coverage

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review M01 milestone requirements and create validation checklist
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration test suite for library functionality
- [ ] Set up isolated test environment for library installation validation
- [ ] Test library integration with fresh React Native project
- [ ] Validate all example app functionality and demonstrations
- [ ] Conduct performance testing with realistic survey scenarios
- [ ] Verify cross-platform functionality and consistency
- [ ] Validate TypeScript integration and developer experience
- [ ] Test error handling and edge case scenarios
- [ ] Document integration test results and M01 completion status
- [ ] Prepare final milestone delivery report

# Task: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Description
Set up a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and validation of the react-native-survey-js-ui library and example app. This includes configuring workflows for pull requests, pushes to main branch, and preparing for automated releases.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish robust CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality and prevents regressions:
- Set up automated testing pipeline for library and example app
- Configure cross-platform testing workflows
- Implement build verification and validation steps
- Prepare foundation for automated npm publishing
- Ensure consistent testing environment across local and CI

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow file created and properly configured
- [ ] CI runs on pull requests and pushes to main branch
- [ ] All library tests execute successfully in CI environment
- [ ] Example app tests execute successfully in CI environment
- [ ] TypeScript compilation validation included in CI
- [ ] Build verification for library distribution included
- [ ] CI fails appropriately when tests fail or build breaks
- [ ] Workflow artifacts preserved for debugging (test reports, coverage)
- [ ] CI execution time optimized (under 10 minutes for full pipeline)

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- `.github/workflows/` directory for GitHub Actions configuration
- `package.json` scripts for test, build, and lint commands
- Jest configuration from T01_S04 for test execution
- TypeScript configuration for compilation validation
- Example app package.json for example app testing

### Implementation Notes
- Use GitHub Actions marketplace actions for Node.js, React Native setup
- Configure proper caching for node_modules and build artifacts
- Set up matrix builds for multiple Node.js versions if needed
- Configure proper environment variables for CI execution
- Ensure Jest CI reporters are configured for GitHub Actions integration
- Include timeout settings to prevent hanging CI jobs

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research GitHub Actions best practices for React Native libraries
- [ ] Create main CI workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- [ ] Configure Node.js setup and dependency installation
- [ ] Add library test execution step with proper reporting
- [ ] Add example app test execution step
- [ ] Configure TypeScript compilation validation
- [ ] Add library build verification step
- [ ] Configure artifact preservation for test reports and coverage
- [ ] Optimize workflow performance with caching strategies
- [ ] Test CI workflow with sample pull request
- [ ] Document CI/CD pipeline configuration and usage

# Task: Library Build Verification System

## Description
Implement automated build verification system to ensure the react-native-survey-js-ui library builds correctly for distribution, validates exports, and maintains proper package structure for npm publication. This includes verifying TypeScript compilation, export integrity, and package.json configuration.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish comprehensive build verification to ensure distribution readiness:
- Validate TypeScript compilation produces correct JavaScript output
- Verify all library exports are accessible and properly typed
- Ensure package.json configuration is correct for npm distribution
- Validate library bundle size and dependency requirements
- Confirm library can be consumed by external React Native projects

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Library builds successfully with TypeScript compilation
- [ ] All exported components and utilities are accessible
- [ ] TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) generated correctly
- [ ] Package.json configuration validates for npm publishing
- [ ] Library bundle size is within acceptable limits
- [ ] Peer dependencies properly configured and validated
- [ ] Build verification script integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Build artifacts properly structured for distribution
- [ ] Export integrity tests pass for all public API surfaces

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- `tsconfig.build.json` for production TypeScript compilation
- `package.json` build scripts and npm configuration
- `src/index.ts` main export file and component exports
- GitHub Actions workflow from T01_S05 for CI integration
- TypeScript declaration file generation and validation

### Implementation Notes
- Use TypeScript compiler for build verification
- Create build verification script that checks export integrity
- Validate package.json fields required for npm publishing
- Check library imports work correctly in isolated environment
- Ensure proper tree-shaking support for consuming applications
- Validate peer dependency resolution

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create TypeScript build configuration for distribution
- [ ] Implement build verification script for export integrity
- [ ] Add package.json validation for npm publishing requirements
- [ ] Create library bundle size monitoring and validation
- [ ] Set up peer dependency validation testing
- [ ] Add build artifact structure validation
- [ ] Integrate build verification into CI pipeline
- [ ] Create tests for library import scenarios
- [ ] Validate TypeScript declaration file generation
- [ ] Document build process and verification requirements

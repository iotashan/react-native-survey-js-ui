# Task: TypeScript Compilation Validation

## Description
Implement comprehensive TypeScript compilation validation in the CI pipeline to ensure type safety, proper TypeScript configuration, and early detection of type errors. This includes validating both library and example app TypeScript code with strict type checking and proper declaration file generation.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish robust TypeScript validation to maintain code quality:
- Validate TypeScript compilation with strict type checking
- Ensure proper TypeScript configuration for library and example app
- Generate and validate TypeScript declaration files
- Catch type errors early in development workflow
- Maintain TypeScript best practices across the codebase

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TypeScript compilation validation runs in CI pipeline
- [ ] Strict TypeScript checking configured and passing
- [ ] Library TypeScript code compiles without errors or warnings
- [ ] Example app TypeScript code compiles without errors or warnings
- [ ] TypeScript declaration files generated correctly for library
- [ ] Type definitions properly exported for library consumers
- [ ] CI fails appropriately when TypeScript errors are present
- [ ] TypeScript configuration optimized for library development
- [ ] Type checking performance optimized for CI execution

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json` configuration files
- GitHub Actions workflow from T01_S05 for CI integration
- TypeScript compiler (tsc) for validation
- Library source code in `src/` directory
- Example app TypeScript configuration in `example/`

### Implementation Notes
- Use TypeScript compiler directly for type checking validation
- Configure strict type checking options for maximum type safety
- Set up separate TypeScript configurations for library vs example app
- Ensure proper import/export type checking across modules
- Validate TypeScript declaration file generation and accuracy
- Optimize TypeScript compilation performance for CI

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review and optimize TypeScript configuration for strict checking
- [ ] Add TypeScript compilation step to CI workflow
- [ ] Configure library-specific TypeScript validation
- [ ] Configure example app TypeScript validation
- [ ] Set up TypeScript declaration file generation validation
- [ ] Add type checking for test files and mock utilities
- [ ] Configure TypeScript error reporting for CI
- [ ] Optimize TypeScript compilation performance
- [ ] Validate TypeScript configuration best practices
- [ ] Document TypeScript setup and validation process

# Task: Real-Time Validation Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive real-time validation that provides immediate feedback as users interact with questions. This system will validate input as users type, select choices, or change values, providing instant feedback without waiting for form submission.

## Goal / Objectives
Create responsive real-time validation for enhanced user experience.
- Implement real-time validation triggers for all question types
- Add debouncing for text input validation to optimize performance
- Create immediate feedback for selection questions
- Integrate real-time validation with visual indicators
- Support enabling/disabling real-time validation per question or survey

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time validation working for TextInput questions with debouncing
- [ ] Immediate validation feedback for radio and checkbox selections
- [ ] Real-time validation can be enabled/disabled per question
- [ ] Validation triggers optimized for performance (debounced, throttled)
- [ ] Visual validation feedback appears immediately
- [ ] Real-time validation respects validation modes (strict, lenient)
- [ ] Performance optimized to prevent UI lag during rapid input
- [ ] Real-time validation works with all validation rules

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with all question components from S09 and S10
- Must integrate with validation foundation from S09
- Must work with survey-core validation system
- Must support M02 validation framework

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React hooks for validation state management
- Follow debouncing patterns for performance optimization
- Use React Native performance optimization patterns
- Follow validation patterns established in previous sprints

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle validation rule execution errors gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for failed real-time validation
- Handle rapid input changes without breaking validation
- Recover from validation system errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Analyze real-time validation requirements for each question type
2. Implement validation triggers with proper debouncing
3. Create real-time validation hooks for question components
4. Add immediate feedback integration with visual indicators
5. Implement performance optimizations for rapid input
6. Add configuration options for real-time validation modes
7. Create validation result caching for performance
8. Create comprehensive tests for all real-time scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Real-time validation must not impact UI performance
- Must be configurable and not forced on all questions
- Must maintain consistency with survey-core validation
- Must support complex validation rules and scenarios

**Testing approach:**
- Test real-time validation with rapid text input
- Test immediate feedback for selection changes
- Test debouncing and performance optimization
- Test validation mode configuration
- Test error handling and recovery
- Test integration with visual feedback systems

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement real-time validation triggers for text input
- [ ] Add debouncing system for text input validation
- [ ] Create immediate validation for selection questions
- [ ] Implement real-time validation hooks for question components
- [ ] Add performance optimizations (throttling, caching)
- [ ] Create configuration system for real-time validation modes
- [ ] Integrate real-time validation with visual feedback
- [ ] Add validation result caching for performance
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage

## Dependencies
- S09 validation integration foundation must be completed
- S09 and S10 question components must be completed
- M02 validation framework must be available

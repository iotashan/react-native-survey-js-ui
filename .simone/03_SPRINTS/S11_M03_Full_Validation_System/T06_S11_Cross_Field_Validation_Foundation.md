# Task: Cross-Field Validation Foundation

## Description
Establish the foundation for cross-field validation that allows validation rules to depend on values from multiple questions. This creates the architectural basis for complex validation scenarios like password confirmation, date range validation, and conditional requirements.

## Goal / Objectives
Create foundation for complex cross-field validation scenarios.
- Implement cross-field validation architecture and hooks
- Create validation dependency tracking between questions
- Add support for conditional validation rules
- Establish foundation for password confirmation scenarios
- Support date range and numeric range cross-validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cross-field validation architecture implemented
- [ ] Validation dependency tracking between questions working
- [ ] Conditional validation rules based on other field values
- [ ] Foundation for password confirmation validation
- [ ] Support for date range and numeric range validation
- [ ] Performance optimized for complex dependency chains
- [ ] Integration with real-time and on-submit validation
- [ ] Extensible foundation for future cross-field scenarios

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with all question components from S09 and S10
- Must integrate with validation systems from T01 and T02
- Must work with survey-core cross-field validation
- Must support validation message system from T03

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React hooks for cross-component state management
- Follow validation patterns established in previous tasks
- Use survey-core dependency tracking patterns
- Follow performance optimization patterns for complex validation

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle circular validation dependencies gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for cross-field validation failures
- Handle missing or invalid referenced fields
- Recover from dependency tracking errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Design cross-field validation architecture
2. Implement validation dependency tracking system
3. Create cross-field validation hooks and context
4. Add conditional validation rule support
5. Implement foundation for password confirmation scenarios
6. Add support for date and numeric range validation
7. Create performance optimizations for dependency chains
8. Create comprehensive tests for cross-field scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Cross-field validation must be performant and not cause validation loops
- Must support complex dependency chains without performance issues
- Must be extensible for future cross-field validation types
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing validation systems

**Testing approach:**
- Test cross-field validation dependency tracking
- Test conditional validation rules based on other fields
- Test password confirmation validation scenarios
- Test date range and numeric range validation
- Test performance with complex dependency chains
- Test integration with real-time and on-submit validation

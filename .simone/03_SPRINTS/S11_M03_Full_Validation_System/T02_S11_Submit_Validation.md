# Task: On-Submit Validation Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive on-submit validation that validates all questions when the user attempts to submit the survey or navigate to the next page. This system provides a final validation check and comprehensive error reporting for the entire form.

## Goal / Objectives
Create robust on-submit validation for comprehensive form validation.
- Implement form-level validation on submit/next page attempts
- Create comprehensive error collection and reporting
- Add validation summary and error navigation
- Support page-level and survey-level validation
- Integrate with survey navigation to prevent invalid submissions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] On-submit validation runs for all questions on the current page
- [ ] Comprehensive error collection and reporting implemented
- [ ] Validation summary shows all errors with navigation to fields
- [ ] Page navigation blocked when validation fails
- [ ] Survey submission blocked when validation fails
- [ ] Error focus management for accessibility
- [ ] Performance optimized for large forms with many questions
- [ ] Integration with survey-core completion logic

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with M02 page navigation system
- Must integrate with all question components from S09 and S10
- Must work with survey-core validation and completion logic
- Must support validation summary and error navigation

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use validation patterns established in previous sprints
- Follow React Navigation patterns for page blocking
- Use React hooks for form-level validation state
- Follow accessibility patterns for error focus management

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle validation rule execution errors gracefully
- Provide comprehensive error reporting for all failed validations
- Handle partial validation failures with clear feedback
- Recover from validation system errors during submission

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-Step implementation approach:**
1. Implement form-level validation collection system
2. Create comprehensive error reporting and summary
3. Add page navigation blocking for validation failures
4. Implement survey submission blocking
5. Add error focus management and navigation
6. Create validation summary component with error list
7. Integrate with survey-core completion logic
8. Create comprehensive tests for all submission scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- On-submit validation must be comprehensive and complete
- Must provide clear feedback about all validation errors
- Must integrate seamlessly with survey navigation
- Must support accessibility requirements for error handling

**Testing approach:**
- Test form-level validation on submit attempts
- Test page navigation blocking for validation failures
- Test comprehensive error collection and reporting
- Test validation summary and error navigation
- Test survey submission blocking
- Test error focus management and accessibility

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement form-level validation collection system
- [ ] Create comprehensive error reporting and summary
- [ ] Add page navigation blocking for validation failures
- [ ] Implement survey submission blocking logic
- [ ] Create error focus management for accessibility
- [ ] Add validation summary component with error navigation
- [ ] Integrate on-submit validation with survey-core completion

# Sprint: Complete Validation System Integration (S11)

## Sprint Goal
Implement comprehensive validation system with real-time and on-submit modes for all question types

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Real-time validation mode implementation
- On-submit validation mode implementation
- Custom validation messages and error display
- Validation state visual indicators
- Cross-field validation foundation
- Advanced text validation (patterns, length, custom rules)

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Real-time validation working for all question types
- On-submit validation working for all question types
- Custom validation messages displaying correctly
- Validation state indicators functional
- Advanced validation rules implemented
- All validation components have >90% test coverage

## Tasks
- [T01_S11_Real_Time_Validation.md](./T01_S11_Real_Time_Validation.md) - Implement real-time validation mode for all question types
- [T02_S11_Submit_Validation.md](./T02_S11_Submit_Validation.md) - Implement on-submit validation mode with comprehensive error handling
- [T03_S11_Custom_Validation_Messages.md](./T03_S11_Custom_Validation_Messages.md) - Create custom validation message system with localization support
- [T04_S11_Validation_Visual_Indicators.md](./T04_S11_Validation_Visual_Indicators.md) - Implement validation state visual indicators and styling
- [T05_S11_Advanced_Text_Validation.md](./T05_S11_Advanced_Text_Validation.md) - Implement advanced text validation (patterns, email, phone, etc.)
- [T06_S11_Cross_Field_Validation_Foundation.md](./T06_S11_Cross_Field_Validation_Foundation.md) - Establish foundation for cross-field validation rules

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Integrate with M02 validation framework
- Ensure validation works seamlessly with all question types from S09 and S10
- Focus on user experience and clear error communication
- Dependencies: S09 and S10 question components must be completed

# Task: Validation Visual Indicators

## Description
Implement comprehensive visual indicators for validation states that provide clear, accessible feedback about validation status. This includes error highlighting, success indicators, warning states, and accessibility-friendly visual cues.

## Goal / Objectives
Create clear and accessible visual validation feedback system.
- Implement validation state visual indicators (error, success, warning)
- Add field highlighting and border styling for validation states
- Create icon-based validation indicators
- Support accessibility requirements for visual feedback
- Integrate with theming system for customizable validation styling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Visual validation state indicators for all question types
- [ ] Field highlighting and border styling for error/success states
- [ ] Icon-based validation indicators (checkmark, warning, error)
- [ ] Accessibility-friendly color contrasts and visual cues
- [ ] Integration with theming system for customization
- [ ] Animated transitions for validation state changes
- [ ] Visual indicators work with both real-time and on-submit validation
- [ ] Performance optimized for smooth visual transitions

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance
**Key integration points:**
- Must work with all question components from S09 and S10
- Must integrate with validation systems from T01 and T02
- Must work with theming system from M01
- Must support accessibility requirements

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Use React Native animation patterns for smooth transitions
- Follow accessibility guidelines for visual indicators
- Use theming patterns established in M01
- Follow React Native styling and performance patterns

**Error handling approach:**
- Handle invalid visual state configurations gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for missing theme values
- Handle animation errors without breaking validation
- Recover from styling calculation errors

## Implementation Notes
**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Design validation state visual specifications
2. Create validation state indicator components
3. Implement field highlighting and border styling
4. Add icon-based validation indicators
5. Create animated transitions for state changes
6. Integrate with theming system
7. Add accessibility support for visual indicators
8. Create comprehensive tests for all visual scenarios

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Visual indicators must not impact form performance
- Must be fully accessible and support screen readers
- Must be customizable through theming system
- Must work across all question types consistently

**Testing approach:**
- Test visual state indicators for all validation states
- Test field highlighting and styling changes
- Test icon-based validation indicators
- Test animated transitions and performance
- Test accessibility features and screen reader support
- Test theming integration and customization

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design validation state visual specifications
- [ ] Create validation state indicator components
- [ ] Implement field highlighting and border styling
- [ ] Add icon-based validation indicators (checkmark, warning, error)
- [ ] Create animated transitions for validation state changes
- [ ] Integrate visual indicators with theming system
- [ ] Add accessibility support for visual validation feedback

- T02 on-submit validation system for state management
- All question components from S09 and S10
- M01 theming system for styling customization

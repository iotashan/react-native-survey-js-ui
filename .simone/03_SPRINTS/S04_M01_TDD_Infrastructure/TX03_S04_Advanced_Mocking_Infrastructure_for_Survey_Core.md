# Task: Advanced Mocking Infrastructure for Survey Core

## Description
Establish comprehensive mocking infrastructure for survey-core dependency and other external libraries to enable isolated unit testing. Current basic mocks exist in jest.setup.js, but need expansion into a robust mocking system that allows testing component behavior independently of survey-core implementation details.

## Goal / Objectives
Create sophisticated mock utilities that enable thorough testing of library components:
- Advanced survey-core SurveyModel mocking with realistic behaviors
- Mock utilities for React Native components and APIs
- Configurable mock responses for different test scenarios
- Helper functions for creating test survey JSON models
- Mock event system that mirrors survey-core event patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive SurveyModel mock that mimics real survey-core behavior
- [ ] Mock utilities for all survey-core classes used by library
- [ ] Test helper functions for creating survey JSON test data
- [ ] Mock React Native components (TextInput, TouchableOpacity, etc.)
- [ ] Configurable mock responses for different test scenarios
- [ ] Mock event system for survey state changes
- [ ] Mock utilities properly isolate components from external dependencies
- [ ] All mocks maintain type safety with TypeScript

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- Existing jest.setup.js with basic navigator/window mocks
- survey-core dependency (SurveyModel, Question classes)
- React Native components used in src/components/
- Type definitions in src/types/SurveyTypes.ts
- Utility functions that interact with survey-core

### Implementation Notes
- Extend existing jest.setup.js with advanced mock utilities
- Create __mocks__ directory for external dependency mocks
- Use Jest manual mocks for survey-core with realistic behavior simulation
- Mock React Native components while preserving testing library functionality
- Create factory functions for generating test survey models
- Implement mock event emitters that match survey-core patterns
- Ensure mocks support both unit and integration test scenarios

## Subtasks
- [x] Analyze survey-core classes and methods used by library components
- [x] Create comprehensive SurveyModel mock with state management
- [x] Develop mock utilities for survey question types
- [x] Create test data factory functions for survey JSON models
- [x] Set up mock React Native components for testing
- [x] Implement mock event system for survey state changes
- [x] Create configurable mock responses for different test scenarios
- [x] Add TypeScript definitions for mock utilities
- [x] Document mock usage patterns and best practices

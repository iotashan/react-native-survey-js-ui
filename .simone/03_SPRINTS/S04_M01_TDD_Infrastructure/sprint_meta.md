# Sprint: TDD Infrastructure (S04)

## Sprint Goal
Establish comprehensive testing framework with >90% code coverage and TDD workflow

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Configure Jest for library testing with React Native
- Set up React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Create comprehensive unit tests in src/__tests__/
- Create integration tests in example/__tests__/
- Set up mock utilities for survey-core and dependencies
- Achieve >90% code coverage with reporting
- Document TDD workflow and best practices

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- All tests pass consistently across platforms
- >90% code coverage achieved and maintained
- Both unit and integration tests comprehensive and meaningful
- TDD workflow documented and functional for future development
- Test suite runs efficiently in development and CI
- Mock utilities properly isolate dependencies for testing

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint ensures code quality and confidence for future development
- Focus on meaningful tests that catch real issues
- Establish patterns for testing React Native library components
- Coverage should be meaningful, not just numerical

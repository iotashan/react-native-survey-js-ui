# Sprint: TDD Infrastructure (S04)

## Sprint Goal
Establish comprehensive testing framework with >90% code coverage and TDD workflow

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Configure Jest for library testing with React Native
- Set up React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Create comprehensive unit tests in src/__tests__/
- Create integration tests in example/__tests__/
- Set up mock utilities for survey-core and dependencies
- Achieve >90% code coverage with reporting
- Document TDD workflow and best practices

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- All tests pass consistently across platforms
- >90% code coverage achieved and maintained
- Both unit and integration tests comprehensive and meaningful
- TDD workflow documented and functional for future development
- Test suite runs efficiently in development and CI
- Mock utilities properly isolate dependencies for testing

## Tasks

### T01: Enhanced Jest Configuration and CI Optimization (Medium)
Configure advanced Jest settings for optimal performance, coverage thresholds >90%, platform-specific testing, and CI/CD integration.

### T02: Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage for Core Components (Medium)
Achieve complete unit test coverage for all Survey, Questions, and utility components with meaningful React Native-specific test scenarios.

### T03: Advanced Mocking Infrastructure for Survey Core (Medium)
Establish sophisticated mocking system for survey-core and React Native dependencies to enable isolated component testing.

### T04: Integration Test Expansion for Example App (Medium)
Expand integration testing for end-to-end survey flows, navigation, and real-world library usage patterns in example app.

### T05: Coverage Optimization and Reporting Setup (Low)
Configure >90% coverage enforcement, detailed reporting, and coverage trend monitoring for CI/CD integration.

### T06: TDD Workflow Documentation and Best Practices (Low)
Create comprehensive TDD workflow documentation and testing best practices guide for React Native library development.

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint ensures code quality and confidence for future development
- Focus on meaningful tests that catch real issues
- Establish patterns for testing React Native library components
- Coverage should be meaningful, not just numerical

# Task: TDD Workflow Documentation and Best Practices

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation for Test-Driven Development workflow and best practices specific to React Native library development. This documentation will guide future development ensuring consistent TDD approach, testing patterns, and quality standards across all project milestones.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish clear TDD guidelines and workflow documentation for project continuity:
- Document TDD workflow for React Native library development
- Create testing best practices guide for component testing
- Document mock usage patterns and strategies
- Establish code review guidelines for TDD compliance
- Create troubleshooting guide for common testing issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive TDD workflow documentation created
- [ ] Testing best practices guide covers React Native library-specific patterns
- [ ] Mock usage documentation with examples and patterns
- [ ] Code review checklist includes TDD compliance verification
- [ ] Testing troubleshooting guide addresses common issues
- [ ] Documentation integrated with project development workflow
- [ ] Examples demonstrate proper TDD implementation for library components
- [ ] Documentation maintained alongside codebase changes

## TDD Requirements (FOR ALL CODING TASKS)
**CRITICAL**: All development must follow Test-Driven Development approach:
- [ ] Write failing tests first (describe expected behavior)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- [ ] No code implementation without corresponding test coverage

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- Project architecture documentation in .simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Existing development workflow in docs/DEVELOPMENT.md
- Current testing infrastructure and patterns
- Sprint and task documentation structure
- Developer onboarding and contribution guidelines

### Implementation Notes
- Create documentation in docs/ directory for developer accessibility
- Reference actual code examples from library and tests
- Document testing patterns specific to React Native library development
- Include troubleshooting for common survey-core integration testing issues
- Provide examples of proper mock usage and test organization
- Create templates for different types of tests (unit, integration, component)

## Subtasks
- [x] Create comprehensive TDD workflow guide
- [x] Document React Native library testing best practices
- [x] Create mock usage guide with practical examples
- [x] Establish code review checklist for TDD compliance
- [x] Create testing troubleshooting and FAQ guide
- [x] Document test organization and naming conventions
- [x] Create test templates for common scenarios
- [x] Integrate TDD documentation with developer workflow
- [x] Review and validate documentation completeness

## Output Log

[2025-06-06 19:40]: Created React Native testing best practices guide in docs/REACT_NATIVE_TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md covering library-specific patterns, cross-platform testing, performance, and accessibility
[2025-06-06 19:46]: Created mock usage guide in docs/MOCK_USAGE_GUIDE.md with practical examples for survey-core and React Native mocking
[2025-06-06 19:52]: Created TDD code review checklist in docs/TDD_CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md ensuring compliance and quality standards
[2025-06-06 19:58]: Created testing troubleshooting FAQ in docs/TESTING_TROUBLESHOOTING_FAQ.md covering common issues and solutions
[2025-06-06 20:05]: Created test organization conventions in docs/TEST_ORGANIZATION_CONVENTIONS.md with structure and naming standards
[2025-06-06 20:12]: Created test templates in docs/TEST_TEMPLATES.md with ready-to-use templates for common scenarios
[2025-06-06 20:18]: Integrated TDD documentation with developer workflow in docs/TDD_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md and updated README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md
[2025-06-06 20:19]: Completed documentation review - all 8 TDD documentation files created with comprehensive coverage of workflow, best practices, troubleshooting, and integration

[2025-06-06 19:48]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All task requirements have been fully satisfied with comprehensive documentation delivery.

**Scope:** T06_S04 TDD Workflow Documentation and Best Practices - Review of 8 created documentation files and integration changes.

**Findings:**
- Issue 1 (Severity: 1): Documentation-only delivery is correct per task requirements - no implementation expected
- Issue 2 (Severity: 2): Task status shows "IN PROGRESS" but all subtasks completed - minor status inconsistency
- Issue 3 (Severity: 3): Documentation files not yet committed to git repository

**Summary:** All acceptance criteria successfully met. Created 8 comprehensive documentation files totaling 154,342 bytes covering TDD workflow, React Native testing best practices, mock usage, code review checklists, troubleshooting, organization conventions, test templates, and workflow integration. README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md properly updated with documentation links.

**Recommendation:** PASS - Task completion ready. Recommend proceeding to finalize task status and commit documentation to repository.

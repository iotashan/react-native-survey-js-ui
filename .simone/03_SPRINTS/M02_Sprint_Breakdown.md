# M02: Page & Panel Layout + Basic Validation - Sprint Breakdown

## Overview
M02 focuses on implementing core survey navigation, layout structure, and foundational validation framework. The milestone builds upon the solid foundation established in M01 and introduces multi-page survey capabilities.

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Key Areas**: Page system, Panel system, Validation framework, Navigation  
**Pattern**: 5-7 tasks per sprint following TDD approach from M01

## Sprint Structure Analysis

Based on M02 requirements and dependencies, the work is organized into 3 logical sprints:

---

## Sprint S06_M02_Page_Navigation_System (Week 1)
**Focus**: Core page navigation and survey progression system

### Technical Foundation
- SurveyPage component for rendering current page questions
- Page navigation controls (Next/Previous buttons) 
- Progress tracking and display integration
- Page validation before navigation transitions

### Tasks (6 tasks)
1. **T01_S06_SurveyPage_Component** - Create SurveyPage component with survey-core integration
2. **T02_S06_PageNavigation_Controls** - Implement Next/Previous navigation buttons with state management
3. **T03_S06_Progress_Tracking** - Build progress indicator with survey.currentPageNo integration
4. **T04_S06_Page_Validation_Logic** - Add page-level validation before navigation
5. **T05_S06_Navigation_State_Management** - Handle navigation button states and survey completion flow
6. **T06_S06_Sample_App_MultiPage_Demo** - Update Survey tab with multi-page navigation demonstration

### Dependencies
- Requires M01 completion (Survey component, hooks system)
- Builds on existing Survey component from S03_M01

---

## Sprint S07_M02_Panel_Layout_System (Week 2)
**Focus**: Panel component system for question grouping and layout

### Technical Foundation  
- Panel component for logical question grouping
- Nested panel support with proper hierarchy
- Panel styling and responsive layout
- Panel collapse/expand functionality

### Tasks (6 tasks)
1. **T01_S07_Panel_Component** - Create base Panel component with nested support
2. **T02_S07_PanelHeader_Component** - Implement PanelHeader with collapse/expand functionality
3. **T03_S07_Panel_Layout_System** - Build panel styling and responsive layout system
4. **T04_S07_Panel_Nesting_Logic** - Implement proper nested panel hierarchy and rendering
5. **T05_S07_Panel_State_Management** - Add panel-level state management (collapsed/expanded states)
6. **T06_S07_Explore_Tab_Panel_Demo** - Add panel functionality demonstration to Explore tab

### Dependencies
- Requires S06 completion (page system as foundation)
- Integrates with existing question architecture from M01

---

## Sprint S08_M02_Validation_Framework (Week 2-3)
**Focus**: Foundational validation system and error handling

### Technical Foundation
- ValidationProvider context for centralized validation state
- Required field validation with real-time and on-submit modes
- Error message display system with proper UX
- Custom validation rule support foundation

### Tasks (7 tasks)
1. **T01_S08_ValidationProvider_Context** - Create ValidationProvider context and state management
2. **T02_S08_ValidationError_Component** - Build ValidationError component for error display
3. **T03_S08_Required_Field_Validation** - Implement required field validation logic
4. **T04_S08_Realtime_OnSubmit_Modes** - Add validation timing options (real-time vs on-submit)
5. **T05_S08_Custom_Validation_Foundation** - Establish custom validation rule support system
6. **T06_S08_Integration_Testing** - Comprehensive integration testing for validation across components
7. **T07_S08_Sample_App_Validation_Examples** - Add validation examples to both Survey and Explore tabs

### Dependencies
- Requires S06 and S07 completion (page and panel systems)
- Integrates validation into existing Survey component architecture

## Integration Points

1. **With M01 Foundation**: Builds on Survey component, hooks system, and test infrastructure
2. **Cross-Sprint Integration**: Page system supports panels, panels integrate with validation
3. **Sample App Updates**: Each sprint updates example app to demonstrate new capabilities

## Quality Standards

- **TDD Approach**: All tasks follow test-driven development from M01
- **Coverage Target**: >90% test coverage maintained
- **Performance**: No regression in survey rendering performance
- **Integration**: Comprehensive integration testing between page, panel, and validation systems

## Risk Mitigation

- **Early Integration**: S08 includes comprehensive integration testing
- **Incremental Development**: Each sprint builds working functionality  
- **Sample App Validation**: Real-world usage demonstrated in example app
- **Dependency Management**: Clear sprint dependencies prevent blocking issues

This breakdown maintains the successful 5-7 tasks per sprint pattern from M01 while organizing work around logical technical boundaries. Each sprint delivers working functionality that builds toward the complete M02 milestone.
